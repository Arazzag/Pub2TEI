      <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">In 1999 Shah<ref type="bibr" target="#B1"
          >1</ref> and others said that the Royal College of General Practitioners should advocate
        longer consultations in general practice as a matter of policy. The college set up a working
        group chaired by A P Hungin, and a systematic review of literature on consultation length in
        general practice was commissioned. The working group agreed that the available evidence
        would be hard to interpret without discussion of the changing context within which
        consultations now take place. For many years general practitioners and those who have
        surveyed patients' opinions in the United Kingdom have complained about short consultation
        time, despite a steady increase in actual mean length. Recently Mechanic pointed out that
        this is also true in the United States.<ref type="bibr" target="#B2">2</ref> Is there any
        justification for a further increase in mean time allocated per consultation in general
        practice?</p>
      <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">We report on the outcome of extensive
        debate among a group of general practitioners with an interest in the process of care, with
        reference to the interim findings of the commissioned systematic review and our personal
        databases. The review identified 14 relevant papers. </p>
      <div type="subjects">
        <head>Longer consultations: benefits for patients</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">The systematic review consistently
          showed that doctors with longer consultation times prescribe less and offer more advice on
          lifestyle and other health promoting activities. Longer consultations have been
          significantly associated with better recognition and handling of psychosocial problems<ref
            type="bibr" target="#B3">3</ref> and with better patient enablement.<ref type="bibr"
            target="#B4">4</ref> Also clinical care for some chronic illnesses is better in
          practices with longer booked intervals between one appointment and the next.<ref
            type="bibr" target="#B5">5</ref> It is not clear whether time is itself the main
          influence or whether some doctors insist on more time.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">A national survey in 1998 reported that
          most (87%) patients were satisfied with the length of their most recent consultation.<ref
            type="bibr" target="#B6">6</ref> Satisfaction with any service will be high if
          expectations are met or exceeded. But expectations are modified by previous
            experience.<ref type="bibr" target="#B7">7</ref> The result is that primary care
          patients are likely to be satisfied with what they are used to unless the context modifies
          the effects of their own experience.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Context of modern consultations</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Shorter consultations were more
          appropriate when the population was younger, when even a brief absence from employment due
          to sickness required a doctor's note, and when many simple remedies were available only on
          prescription. Recently at least five important influences have increased the content and
          hence the potential length of the consultation.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Participatory consultation style</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">The most effective consultations are
          those in which doctors most directly acknowledge and perhaps respond to patients' problems
          and concerns. In addition, for patients to be committed to taking advantage of medical
          advice they must agree with both the goals and methods proposed. A landmark publication in
          the United Kingdom was <hi rend="italic">Meetings Between Experts</hi>, which argued that
          while doctors are the experts about medical problems in general patients are the experts
          on how they themselves experience these problems.<ref type="bibr" target="#B8">8</ref> New
          emphasis on teaching consulting skills in general practice advocated specific attention to
          the patient's agenda, beliefs, understanding, and agreement. Currently the General Medical
          Council, aware that communication difficulties underlie many complaints about doctors, has
          further emphasised the importance of involving patients in consultations in its revised
          guidance to medical schools.<ref type="bibr" target="#B9">9</ref> More patient involvement
          should give a better outcome, but this participatory style usually lengthens
          consultations.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Extended professional agenda</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">The traditional consultation in general
          practice was brief.<ref type="bibr" target="#B2">2</ref> The patient presented symptoms
          and the doctor prescribed treatment. In 1957 Balint gave new insights into the meaning of
            symptoms.<ref type="bibr" target="#B10">10</ref> By 1979 an enhanced model of
          consultation was presented, in which the doctors dealt with ongoing as well as presenting
          problems and added health promotion and education about future appropriate use of
            services.<ref type="bibr" target="#B11">11</ref> Now, with an ageing population and more
          community care of chronic illness, there are more issues to be considered at each
          consultation. Ideas of what constitutes good general practice are more complex.<ref
            type="bibr" target="#B12">12</ref> Good practice now includes both extended care of
          chronic medical problems—for example, coronary heart disease<ref type="bibr" target="#B13"
            >13</ref>—and a public health role. At first this model was restricted to those who lead
          change (“early adopters”) and enthusiasts<ref type="bibr" target="#B14">14</ref> but now
          it is embedded in professional and managerial expectations of good practice.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Adequate time is essential. It may be
          difficult for an elderly patient with several active problems to undress, be examined, and
          get adequate professional consideration in under 15 minutes. Here the doctor is faced with
          the choice of curtailing the consultation or of reducing the time available for the next
          patient. Having to cope with these situations often contributes to professional
            dissatisfaction.<ref type="bibr" target="#B15">15</ref> This combination of more care,
          more options, and more genuine discussion of those options with informed patient choice
          inevitably leads to pressure on time.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Access problems</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">In a service free at the point of
          access, rising demand will tend to increase rationing by delay. But attempts to improve
          access by offering more consultations at short notice squeeze consultation times.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">While appointment systems can and
          should reduce queuing time for consultations, they have long tended to be used as a brake
          on total demand.<ref type="bibr" target="#B16">16</ref> This may seriously erode patients'
          confidence in being able to see their doctor or nurse when they need to. Patients are
          offered appointments further ahead but may keep these even if their symptoms have remitted
          “just in case.” Availability of consultations is thus blocked. Receptionists are then
          inappropriately blamed for the inadequate access to doctors.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">In response to perception of delay, the
          government has set targets in the NHS plan of “guaranteed access to a primary care
          professional within 24 hours and to a primary care doctor within 48 hours.” Implementation
          is currently being negotiated.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Virtually all patients think that they
          would not consult unless it was absolutely necessary. They do not think they are wasting
          NHS time and do not like being made to feel so. But underlying general practitioners'
          willingness to make patients wait several days is their perception that few of the
          problems are urgent. Patients and general practitioners evidently do not agree about the
          urgency of so called minor problems. To some extent general practice in the United Kingdom
          may have scored an “own goal” by setting up perceived access barriers (appointment systems
          and out of hours cooperatives) in the attempt to increase professional standards and
          control demand in a service that is free at the point of access.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">A further government initiative has
          been to bypass general practice with new services—notably, walk-in centres (primary care
          clinics in which no appointment is needed) and NHS Direct (a professional telephone
          helpline giving advice on simple remedies and access to services). Introduced widely and
          rapidly, these services each potentially provide significant features of primary
          care—namely, quick access to skilled health advice and first line treatment.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Loss of interpersonal continuity</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">If a patient has to consult several
          different professionals, particularly over a short period of time, there is inevitable
          duplication of stories, risk of naive diagnoses, potential for conflicting advice, and
          perhaps loss of trust. Trust is essential if patients are to accept the “wait and see”
          management policy which is, or should be, an important part of the management of self
          limiting conditions, which are often on the boundary between illness and non-illness.<ref
            type="bibr" target="#B17">17</ref> Such duplication again increases pressure for more
          extra (unscheduled) consultations resulting in late running and professional
            frustration.<ref type="bibr" target="#B18">18</ref>
        </p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Mechanic described how loss of
          longitudinal (and perhaps personal and relational<ref type="bibr" target="#B19">19</ref>)
          continuity influences the perception and use of time through an inability to build on
          previous consultations.<ref type="bibr" target="#B2">2</ref> Knowing the doctor well,
          particularly in smaller practices, is associated with enhanced patient enablement in
          shorter time.<ref type="bibr" target="#B4">4</ref> Though Mechanic pointed out that three
          quarters of UK patients have been registered with their general practitioner five years or
          more, this may be misleading. Practices are growing, with larger teams and more registered
          patients. Being registered with a doctor in a larger practice is usually no guarantee that
          the patient will be able to see the same doctor or the doctor of his or her choice, who
          may be different. Thus the system does not encourage adequate personal continuity. This
          adds to pressure on time and reduces both patient and professional satisfaction.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Health service reforms</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Finally, for the past 15 years the NHS
          has experienced unprecedented change with a succession of major administrative reforms.
          Recent reforms have focused on an NHS led by primary care, including the aim of shifting
          care from the secondary specialist sector to primary care. One consequence is increased
          demand for primary care of patients with more serious and less stable problems. With the
          limited piloting of reforms we do not know whether such major redirection can be achieved
          without greatly altering the delicate balance between expectations (of both patients and
          staff) and what is delivered.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>The future</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">We think that the way ahead must
          embrace both longer mean consultation times and more flexibility. More time is needed for
          high quality consultations with patients with major and complex problems of all kinds. But
          patients also need access to simpler services and advice. This should be more appropriate
          (and cost less) when it is given by professionals who know the patient and his or her
          medical history and social circumstances. For doctors, the higher quality associated with
          longer consultations may lead to greater professional satisfaction and, if these longer
          consultations are combined with more realistic scheduling, to reduced levels of
            stress.<ref type="bibr" target="#B20">20</ref> They will also find it easier to develop
          further the care of chronic disease.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">The challenge posed to general practice
          by walk-in centres and NHS Direct is considerable, and the diversion of funding from
          primary care is large. The risk of waste and duplication increases as more layers of
          complexity are added to a primary care service that started out as something familiar,
          simple, and local and which is still envied in other developed countries.<ref type="bibr"
            target="#B21">21</ref> Access needs to be simple, and the advantages of personal
          knowledge and trust in minimising duplication and overmedicalisation need to be
          exploited.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">We must ensure better communication and
          access so that patients can more easily deal with minor issues and queries with someone
          they know and trust and avoid the formality and inconvenience of a full face to face
          consultation. Too often this has to be with a different professional, unfamiliar with the
          nuances of the case. There should be far more managerial emphasis on helping patients to
          interact with their chosen practitioner<ref type="bibr" target="#B22">22</ref>; such a
          programme has been described.<ref type="bibr" target="#B23">23</ref> Modern information
          systems make it much easier to record which doctor(s) a patient prefers to see and to
          monitor how often this is achieved. The telephone is hardly modern but is underused. Email
          avoids the problems inherent in arranging simultaneous availability necessary for
          telephone consultations but at the cost of reducing the communication of emotions. There
          is a place for both.<ref type="bibr" target="#B2">2</ref> Access without prior appointment
          is a valued feature of primary care, and we need to know more about the right balance
          between planned and ad hoc consulting.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Next steps</head>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">General practitioners do not behave in
          a uniform way. They can be categorised as slow, medium, and fast and react in different
          ways to changes in consulting speed.<ref type="bibr" target="#B18">18</ref> They are
          likely to have differing views about a widespread move to lengthen consultation time. We
          do not need further confirmation that longer consultations are desirable and necessary,
          but research could show us the best way to learn how to introduce them with minimal
          disruption to the way in which patients and practices like primary care to be
            provided.<ref type="bibr" target="#B24">24</ref> We also need to learn how to make the
          most of available time in complex consultations.</p>
        <p xmlns:ce="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/common/dtd">Devising appropriate incentives and
          helping practices move beyond just reacting to demand in the traditional way by working
          harder and faster is perhaps our greatest challenge in the United Kingdom. The new primary
          are trusts need to work together with the growing primary care research networks to carry
          out the necessary development work. In particular, research is needed on how a primary
          care team can best provide the right balance of quick access and interpersonal knowledge
          and trust.</p>
