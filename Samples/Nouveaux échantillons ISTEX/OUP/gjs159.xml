<body><p>THOMAS Dekker, along with Ben Jonson, Stephen Harrison, and the artists of the Italian and Dutch communities, was commissioned by the Stuart Court to design individual parts of <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic> (1604) for King James I&rsquo;s royal entry into London.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN1"><sup>1</sup></xref> To glorify James as the first emperor of united Britain (2515&ndash;19), these inventors all turned to Martial, Virgil, Ovid, Homer, Plutarch, Claudian <italic>et al.</italic> where they could find genealogical and imperial claims to endorse Britain&rsquo;s Roman lineage and her place on the world stage.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> Amongst these sources, the use of Virgil&rsquo;s literary motif&mdash;&lsquo;<italic>translatio imperii</italic>&rsquo;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref>&mdash;and the &lsquo;land&rsquo; arguments extracted from the <italic>Aeneid</italic> and the pastoral writings constitute the fundamental approach to the making of Britain&rsquo;s national narrative. Jonson in the pageant for his Londinium arch located at Fenchurch borrows Virgil&rsquo;s epic style and language of the &lsquo;plough&rsquo; to write about the founding of the city from Brutus&rsquo; time to the birth of a new nation (529&ndash;31, 545&ndash;48, 658&ndash;62, 780&ndash;85).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref> Appropriating the animistic and anthropomorphic voices from Virgil&rsquo;s <italic>Aeneid</italic> to evoke the spirits of the place, Jonson envisions Tamesis as Tiber (605&ndash;9) and calls forth the presence of Genius Urbis to engage them in dialogue that eulogizes James&rsquo; kingship and the glory of the city (765&ndash;865). In the pageant for the Temple of Janus located at Temple Bar, Jonson draws on the prophetic voice of the <italic>Aeneid</italic> to &lsquo;elicit&rsquo; the &lsquo;soul&rsquo; &lsquo;out of Virgil&rsquo; (2392&ndash;93, 2400&ndash;01, 2540&ndash;45), creating a theatrical scene for the return of the golden age: &lsquo;REDEVNT SATVRNIA REGNA&rsquo; (2390&ndash;91).</p>
<p>As for Dekker the event narrator (as opposed to Dekker the individual inventor), he adopts Virgil&rsquo;s epic voice that characterizes the <italic>Aeneid</italic> as his storytelling technique to outline other contributors&rsquo; parts in <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic>. Dekker informs the reader that the Italians not only cite Virgil&rsquo;s lines and dense political allusions (889&ndash;1017) to inaugurate James as the &lsquo;surest hope of the state&rsquo; (&lsquo;Spes o fidissima rerum&rsquo;, 947) and &lsquo;the second hope of great Rome&rsquo; (&lsquo;Spes altera&rsquo;, 963) but also translate the Virgilian imagery of the &lsquo;plenteous&rsquo; earth and perpetual &lsquo;Spring&rsquo; from the Fourth Eclogue into one of the square tables of the arch (995&ndash;98). Dekker writes, the &lsquo;soul that gave life to&rsquo; &lsquo;the speaking picture was&rsquo;
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p>Omnis feret omnia tellus.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>(&lsquo;Every land shall bear all fruits&rsquo;, 998, originally in <italic>Eclogue</italic> 4.39).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN5"><sup>5</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although the Dutch community does not directly cite Virgil, Dekker tells the reader that their congratulatory eulogy&mdash;James as the restorer of the world, founder of peace, and champion of religion (1086&ndash;98)&mdash;is in line with that of the Italians. The Virgilian imagery of &lsquo;peace&rsquo; and &lsquo;perpetual spring&rsquo; is also instituted in one of the square engravings encased on the fa&ccedil;ade of the arch: the browsing sheep, nibbling lambs, and flying birds are the visual tropes that constitute the &lsquo;arguments of a serene and untroubled season whose happiness was proclaimed&rsquo; (1136&ndash;39). Moreover, as Dekker the event narrator finishes off Jonson&rsquo;s part in the last pageant (2644&ndash;725) where the theatrical character Electra (one of the Pleiades, mother of Dardanus and founder of Rome) gives her blessings to &lsquo;so lasting glory to Augustus&rsquo; state&rsquo; (2643), he cites a passage from the <italic>Aeneid</italic> (I. 607&ndash;10) that sings the river and landscape to perpetuate the glory of Britain&rsquo;s new monarch (2663&ndash;70).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN6"><sup>6</sup></xref> Writing the national narrative for the &lsquo;four kingdoms&rsquo; (1004&ndash;05), Dekker always seeks a univocal voice that prophesies the empire&rsquo;s future: &lsquo;Concordes stabili Fatorum numine&rsquo; (&lsquo;Voicing in unison the fixed will of Destiny&rsquo;, 1007, originally in <italic>Eclogues</italic> 4.47) is &lsquo;the language of them all&rsquo; (1006).</p>
<p>However, this Virgil-inspired entertainment text is much more complex than it appears. It has been noticed that as an individual inventor, Dekker is not so much interested in inventing a new iconography for James as in showcasing the state symbols of Queen Elizabeth.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN7"><sup>7</sup></xref> In the published text, which documents Dekker&rsquo;s original intention, the cancelled performance of the female genius loci (personifying Elizabeth), Arabia Britannica (staged at Nova Faelix Arabia), the goddesses of Peace and Plenty as well as Ceres and Pomona (at Hortus Euporiae), and Astraea, Ar&ecirc;te, and Fortuna (at the New World Arch) are the theatrical apparatus advanced by Dekker that aims to memorialize the old queen. As Frances Yates and Helen Cooper indicate that most Elizabethan symbolisms are rooted in the Virgilian tradition<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN8"><sup>8</sup></xref>, I am going to argue that as an individual inventor, Dekker&rsquo;s Virgilian approach to <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic> is different from his collaborators&rsquo;. While Jonson and others adopt Virgil&rsquo;s &lsquo;epic voice&rsquo; to make claims for the empire&rsquo;s origins and future, Dekker evokes the spirits and voices of the place in Virgil&rsquo;s writings to make claims for Britain&rsquo;s &lsquo;feminine&rsquo; &lsquo;place&rsquo;, the Elizabethan past. If the entire conception of <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic> is modelled on Virgil&rsquo;s <italic>translatio imperii</italic> whose &lsquo;epic&rsquo;, prophetic &lsquo;voice&rsquo; serves the speaking voice for the empire, in the same text there must be &lsquo;further voices&rsquo; to hearken to. By R. O. A. M. Lyne&rsquo;s definition, Virgil&rsquo;s &lsquo;further voices&rsquo; contrast the &lsquo;patriotic and inspiriting&rsquo; epic voice which &lsquo;speaks to those&rsquo; &lsquo;with positive expectations&rsquo; for the new age. &lsquo;Further voices&rsquo; in Virgil&rsquo;s narrative may be &lsquo;disturbing&rsquo; and &lsquo;even shocking&rsquo;. They &lsquo;add to, comment upon, question, and occasionally subvert the implications of the epic voice&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN9"><sup>9</sup></xref> Just like the ways in which Virgil embeds &lsquo;further voices&rsquo; in the <italic>Aeneid</italic>, I am going to demonstrate that Dekker in his parts uses Virgil&rsquo;s &lsquo;allusion&rsquo;, &lsquo;imagery&rsquo;, and the strategy of &lsquo;deviant focalization&rsquo;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN10"><sup>10</sup></xref> to speak otherwise. It is on these grounds that Dekker&rsquo;s devices are considered singular because Virgil&rsquo;s approach to politics for Dekker the nostalgic Elizabethan is an implicit &lsquo;ideological vehicle&rsquo;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN11"><sup>11</sup></xref> with which he could address the &lsquo;strange&rsquo;, &lsquo;outlandish&rsquo; &lsquo;change&rsquo; that defines the &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo; 1604 (<italic>The Wonderful Year</italic>, B2<sup>r</sup>), a year that experienced in relentless succession Elizabeth&rsquo;s death, the onslaught of the plague, and the lavish celebration of James&rsquo; arrival. To tease out the meanings of Dekker&rsquo;s Virgilian arguments embedded in this seminal festival text published in Edinburgh (STC 6512) and London (STC 6510, 6513) that bears Dekker&rsquo;s authorship,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN12"><sup>12</sup></xref> I want to turn to some specific examples in <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic> to look at the unnoticed use of Virgil&rsquo;s sources in Dekker&rsquo;s parts in conjunction with <italic>The Wonderful Year</italic>, a plague pamphlet also by Dekker, which he &lsquo;in priuate presented to the King&rsquo; (B2<sup>v</sup>) as a companion text.</p>
<p>Reading Virgil, Dekker appropriates various Virgilian tropes to denote his critical position. The first one is the Trojan horse allusion implicitly referred to in the beginning of the text where Dekker describes Londoners&rsquo; busy preparations for the construction of the triumphal arches. As soon as Dekker&rsquo;s female genius loci finishes her speech, Dekker writes about the whole city&rsquo;s jubilance to indicate the change of regime. To find a festive &lsquo;mood&rsquo;, Dekker reworks a scene from the second book of the <italic>Aeneid</italic> (2.235&ndash;39) from which he takes three Latin quotations that describe the Trojans&rsquo; easy acceptance of the Greek gift to serve the mood of his new narrative. Dekker&rsquo;s refashioned narrative is as follows:
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p>In a moment, therefore of time are carpenters, joiners, carvers, and other artificers sweating at their chisels.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p><italic>Accingunt Omnes operi</italic>.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Virgil</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>Not a finger but had an office: he was held unworthy even after to &lsquo;suck the honeydew of peace&rsquo; that &lsquo;against his coming, by whom our peace wears a triple wreath&rsquo;, would offer to play the drone. The streets are surveyed: heights, breadths, and distances taken, as it were to make fortifications, for the solemnities. Seven pieces of ground like so many fields for a battle are plotted forth, upon which these arches of triumph must show themselves in their glory; aloft, in the end do they advance their proud foreheads.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p><italic>Circum pueri, innuptaeque puellae,</italic></p>
<p><italic>Sacra canunt, funemque manu contingere gaudent.</italic></p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Virgil</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>Even children, might they have been suffered, would gladly have spent their little strength about the engines that mounted up the frames, such a fire of love and joy was kindled in every breast (389&ndash;409).</p></disp-quote>
At first glance Dekker seems to have only transcribed the &lsquo;mood&rsquo; from Virgil to reflect Londoners&rsquo; keen anticipation for the king&rsquo;s arrival. However, it is necessary to note that the Latin quotations are intended to insinuate different ways of interpreting the event. Virgil&rsquo;s text is as follows.
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p>Accingunt omnes operi pedibusque rotarum</p>
<p>subiciunt lapsus et stuppea vincula collo</p>
<p>intendunt. scandit fatalis machina muros,</p>
<p>feta armis. pueri circum innuptaeque puellae</p>
<p>sacra canunt funemque manu contingere gaudent;</p>
<p>illa subit mediaeque minans inlabitur urbi. (<italic>Aeneid</italic>, 2.235&ndash;39)</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>(&lsquo;All gird themselves for the work; under the feet they place gliding wheels, and about the neck stretch hemp bands. The fateful engine climbs our walls, big with arms. Around it boys and unwedded girls chant holy songs and delight to touch the cable with their hands. Up it moves, and glides threatening into the city&rsquo;s midst&rsquo;.)</p></disp-quote>
It is implied in Virgil that despite Laoco&ouml;n&rsquo;s warning about the Greek gift, the Trojans still bring the wooden horse into the heart of the city. Dekker&rsquo;s refashioned text being framed in the Trojan mode, the implied Trojan horse is reconceived as the triumphal arches, and the &lsquo;fatalis machina&rsquo; (&lsquo;fateful engine&rsquo;) as the &lsquo;working engines that mount up the frames&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN13"><sup>13</sup></xref> The Trojans are re-imagined as na&iuml;ve children in London, and the Trojans&rsquo; ecstasy about the ending of the Trojan war as the &lsquo;fire of love and joy&rsquo; &lsquo;kindled in every breast&rsquo;. As it is evident, Virgil&rsquo;s tone in Dekker&rsquo;s passage serves as an embedded &lsquo;point of view&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN14"><sup>14</sup></xref> Dekker&rsquo;s use of Virgil&rsquo;s text is discreet not only because he was rigorously drilled in the translation exercises of classical texts<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN15"><sup>15</sup></xref> but because from Virgil Dekker could find a critical voice to address the change. Elsewhere in <italic>The Wonderful Year</italic> he also uses Virgil&rsquo;s pastoral idioms to write a pastoral elegy for Elizabeth&rsquo;s passing, and castigates Londoners&rsquo; fickleness, their &lsquo;immoderate joy&rsquo; as well as the radical cultural change in post-Elizabeth London (B1<sup>r</sup>&ndash;B2<sup>v</sup>, B4<sup>r</sup>, C1<sup>r</sup>&ndash;C1<sup>v</sup>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN16"><sup>16</sup></xref> In it Dekker&rsquo;s warning for the Londoners corresponds to the implicit message in <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic>:
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>Whilst Troy was swilling sack and sugar and mowsing fat venison, the mad Greekes made bonfires of their houses. Old Priam was drinking a health to the wodden horse and, before it would be pledg[e]d, had his throat cut &hellip; for in the Appenine height of this immoderate joy and securitie (that like Powles Steeple ouer-lookt the whole Cittie) Behold, that miracle-worker who in one minute turnd our generall mourning to a generall mirth does now again in a moment alter that gladnes to shri[e]ks &amp; lamentation (C2<sup>v</sup>&ndash;C3<sup>r</sup>).</p></disp-quote>
If we set the aforesaid passages cheek by jowl, we may conclude that the implied Trojan horse allusion is purposefully done as Dekker&rsquo;s scepticism is quietly uncompromising.</p>
<p>Dekker&rsquo;s uneasiness about 1604 determines the ways he conceptualized his devices for the triumphal arches. In <italic>The Wonderful Year</italic>, he mentions that ever since Elizabeth&rsquo;s death, &lsquo;Never did the English Nation behold so much black worne&rsquo; and all the &lsquo;pauement&rsquo; that &lsquo;should instead of greene rushes, be strewed with blasted Rosemary, withered Hyacinthes, fatal Cipresse and Ewe[yew]&rsquo; are now &lsquo;thickly mingled with heapes of dead mens bones&rsquo; (B2<sup>r</sup>&ndash;C4<sup>r</sup>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN17"><sup>17</sup></xref> Imagining the apocalyptic visions of successive deaths that devastated the English soil, Dekker intends to use Virgil&rsquo;s arguments of the plenteous earth to redefine and reassert the local characteristics and subjectivity of Elizabeth&rsquo;s England, the heart of James&rsquo; Empire.</p>
<p>Hortus Euporiae (the Garden of Peace and Plenty) is such an invention inspired by Virgil&rsquo;s <italic>Eclogues</italic> that portrays the herdsmen inhabiting the idyllic world where they sing amoebaean songs to lament and embrace the political change or (un)happy love. The emotional context of the <italic>Eclogues&mdash;</italic>the crises of civil war and tensions of the land<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN18"><sup>18</sup></xref>&mdash;would furnish Dekker with a translatable setting for post-Elizabeth, post-plague England when the English felt anxious about the &lsquo;horror of a change&rsquo;, which was going to alter &lsquo;the Map of a Countrey&rsquo; (B2<sup>v</sup>). Central to the conception of Hortus Euporiae is the Fourth Eclogue, whose &lsquo;song of the woodland&rsquo; (IV.3) is sung by the suffering people who anticipate a peaceful future.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN19"><sup>19</sup></xref> Hoping the new ruler would initiate an age of peace and prosperity, Virgil prophesies the beginning of the new century ushered in by the birth of a child hailed as &lsquo;Apollo&rsquo;:
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p>Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;</p>
<p>magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo.</p>
<p>iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;</p>
<p>iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.</p>
<p>tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum</p>
<p>desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,</p>
<p>casta fave Lucina: tuus iam regnat Apollo. (<italic>Eclogue</italic> IV, 4&ndash;10)</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>(&lsquo;Now is come the last age of Cumaean song; the great line of the centuries begins anew. Now the Virgin returns, the reign of Saturn returns; now a new generation descends from heaven on high. Only do you, pure Lucina, smile on the birth of the child, under whom the iron brood shall at last cease and a golden race spring up throughout the world. Your own Apollo now is king&rsquo;.)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Virgil in this poem then envisions the bounteous land producing crops: &lsquo;the earth untilled will pour forth its pretty gifts&rsquo;, &lsquo;every land will bear all fruits&rsquo; and &lsquo;the earth will not suffer the harrow&rsquo; (IV.18&ndash;20, 39&ndash;40). The gifts of the land are of assorted varieties and &lsquo;colores&rsquo; (IV.42): &lsquo;gadding ivy with foxglove&rsquo; growing everywhere, &lsquo;Egyptian bean blended with the laughing briar&rsquo;, the land pouring forth &lsquo;a cradle of smiling flowers&rsquo;, &lsquo;Assyrian spice springing up on every soil&rsquo;, the &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; &lsquo;plains&rsquo; &lsquo;with waving corn&rsquo;, and &lsquo;the purple grape&rsquo; hanging on &lsquo;wild brambles&rsquo; (IV.20&ndash;22, 25, 28&ndash;30). The imagery of plenty thus constitutes a significant wish-fulfilling trope that contrasts the turmoil of the real world, &lsquo;the Waste Land of the dying Roman Republic&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN20"><sup>20</sup></xref></p>
<p>Such imagery also corresponds to that of the field crops in the eulogy of Italy in Virgil&rsquo;s <italic>Georgics</italic> (II. 136&ndash;76) that celebrates the unification of Italy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN21"><sup>21</sup></xref> Virgil writes that Italy is a land of wondrous wealth filled with teeming crops and Bacchus juice. It is the home of olive and fattened flocks (II.143&ndash;45). In this bounteous land that yields the hardest vine and grapes, spring and summer are perpetual (II.149, 190&ndash;92). Significantly, this rich soil, the land of Saturn, is feminine as she is the mighty mother of crops and men and of Caesar (II.165&ndash;70). Writing the national eulogy, Virgil calls forth the power of the indigenous place:
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p>Nunc locus arvorum ingeniis, quae robora cuique,</p>
<p>quis color et quae sit rebus natura ferendis. (<italic>Georgics</italic> II.177&ndash;78)</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>(&lsquo;Now give we place to the genius of the soils, the strength of each, its hue, its native power for bearing&rsquo;.)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Most importantly, as Virgil insinuatingly suggests, &lsquo;Blessed is he&rsquo; who learns &lsquo;the laws of nature&rsquo;s working&rsquo; and &lsquo;happy&rsquo; &lsquo;is he who knows the rural gods, Pan and aged Silvanus and the sisterhood of the Nymphs&rsquo; (II.490&ndash;94), the embodiment of the spirits of the place.</p>
<p>From the Fourth Eclogue (and the eulogy of Italy in the <italic>Georgics</italic>), Dekker translates the Virgilian tropes of the bounteous earth, its gifts, and the peace king&rsquo;s arrival into the English setting where Hortus Euporiae would epitomize Virgil&rsquo;s ideas of peace and plenty. Contrasting the classical triumphal arch dense with Roman attributes as typified in Jonson&rsquo;s Londinium, Hortus Euporiae is a unique invention embellished with fruits, flowers, and crops&mdash;England&rsquo;s gifts to James&mdash;that fully express the local spirits and colours of England.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN22"><sup>22</sup></xref> Dekker tells us that the upper part of the arch is &lsquo;a summer arbour closed with round tops&rsquo;. The &lsquo;garnishments&rsquo; for the whole bower are &lsquo;apples, pears, cherries, grapes, roses, lilies, and all other&rsquo; &lsquo;fruits and flowers&rsquo; &lsquo;moulded to the life&rsquo; (1722&ndash;24). In the middle part of the arch on the edge of a frieze runs along &lsquo;the full breadth of the arbour&rsquo;, and at its feet are &lsquo;planted ranks of artificial artichokes and roses&rsquo; (1787&ndash;89), the symbol of Tudor eglantine. Inside the arched hallways, &lsquo;cucumbers, pompions, grapes and all other fruits growing in the land&rsquo; are hanging &lsquo;in clusters&rsquo; (1711&ndash;12) on the walls. As Dekker renders the Virgilian tropes in his English imaginings, the translated gifts become the performing gifts given to James, which epitomize the Virgilian idea that &lsquo;every land will bear all fruits&rsquo; (998), a visual representation that also echoes the Italians&rsquo; eulogy for Britain.</p>
<p>To dramatize the &lsquo;strength&rsquo; (&lsquo;robora&rsquo;) and &lsquo;hue&rsquo; (&lsquo;color&rsquo;) of the mother land, Dekker locates the tutelary deities, Sylvanus and &lsquo;sylvans&rsquo; his &lsquo;green followers&rsquo; (1692, ubiquitous in the <italic>Eclogues</italic> and the <italic>Georgics</italic>) in Hortus Euporiae to evoke the genius of the soils. In the drama performed in the place of Peace and her daughter Plenty, Sylvanus plays Peace&rsquo;s &lsquo;messenger&rsquo; (1644), who escorts the king to walk into the garden where he is hailed as another Apollo (1633). As Sylvanus makes his appearance, he also introduces the &lsquo;principal persons&rsquo; (1732) of the arch: Peace and Plenty, whose iconographical presence not only embodies Virgil&rsquo;s ideas of peace and plenty but also implies the theatrical presence of Elizabeth, who, in visual art, is often associated with the two goddesses.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN23"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
<p>As Dekker insinuatingly suggests, these two &lsquo;maidens&rsquo; are &lsquo;in memory of a Virgin&rsquo; &lsquo;to whom they were nurse children&rsquo; (1668&ndash;69). This &lsquo;land&rsquo;, as Dekker maintains, &lsquo;should be her inheritance&rsquo; (1652&ndash;53). (In <italic>The Wonderful Year</italic> a corresponding view can also be found where Dekker always sees Elizabeth as the &lsquo;great Land Lady&rsquo; of England, B3<sup>r</sup>&ndash;B4.) Peace being dramatized as the &lsquo;Lady&rsquo; &lsquo;of the place&rsquo; &lsquo;who carefully prune[s] this garden&rsquo; (1845&ndash;48), her presence also recalls the cancelled performance of the female genius loci, whose voice should have been heard. Continuously using Virgil&rsquo;s arguments to stage Elizabeth&rsquo;s state symbols, Dekker also presents Pomona and Ceres, the goddesses of &lsquo;garden fruits&rsquo; and &lsquo;agriculture&rsquo; (1761&ndash;66, ubiquitous in Virgil&rsquo;s pastoral writings), whose iconographical attributes, as Frances Yates and Helen Cooper observe, form part of the religious apparatus for the cult of Elizabeth.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN24"><sup>24</sup></xref></p>
<p>In <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic>, Dekker is as equally interested in presenting the iconography of Elizabeth as in creating &lsquo;voices&rsquo; of her place. As James walks into Elizabeth&rsquo;s garden of plenty, he would not only see Elizabeth&rsquo;s state iconography but also hear the players of the nine muses and the seven liberal arts &lsquo;sing&rsquo; the apotheosis of Daphnis, lines taken verbatim from Virgil&rsquo;s <italic>Aeneid</italic> (III.395) and the Fifth Eclogue (V.58&ndash;64):
<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p><italic>Adertique vocatus Apollo.</italic></p></disp-quote>

<disp-quote content-type="poem"><p><italic>Ergo alacris sylvas, et caetera rura voluptas</italic></p>

<p>If Virgil in this eclogue intends to bring up the death of Daphnis (troping our &lsquo;shepherd&rsquo;, the embodiment of the spirit of the place, 5.43&ndash;44)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN26"><sup>26</sup></xref> to insinuate the death of Julius Caesar (Italy&rsquo;s former ruler before Octavian),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN27"><sup>27</sup></xref> Dekker also attempts to pick up this political signifier to highlight a specific cultural moment of the death of Daphne, England&rsquo;s &lsquo;Queene of shepheardes&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN28"><sup>28</sup></xref> Just as Virgil in his pastorals reiterates the importance of the presence and voices of the local spirits, Dekker at Hortus Euporiae delivers the voices of the place to hail James as the inheritor of Elizabeth&rsquo;s place, whose &lsquo;genius&rsquo;, &lsquo;strength&rsquo;, &lsquo;hue&rsquo;, and &lsquo;power of bearing&rsquo; are all indebted to the Virgin Mother (1829&ndash;55). Just as Virgil&rsquo;s <italic>Georgics</italic> is &lsquo;permeated with religious feeling&rsquo; about pre-Octavian Italy,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN29"><sup>29</sup></xref> Hortus Euporiae is invested with numinous feelings and verdant memories of Elizabeth. Using Virgil to present the complex moods of the pastoral world, Dekker in his invention also attempts to create a new aesthetic language (as testified in the picture language of Stephen Harrison&rsquo;s illustration) that characterizes the mood of the English.</p>
<p>In view of a nation that had to accept the &lsquo;strange&rsquo; and &lsquo;outlandish change&rsquo;, Dekker assumes spiritual urgency and at the heart of the New World Arch staged three state symbols of Elizabeth&mdash;Astraea, Ar&ecirc;te, and Fortuna&mdash;to guard Britain. Amongst them, Astraea is the most powerful Virgilian symbol that associates Elizabeth with the goddess of justice, peace, and virtue.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN30"><sup>30</sup></xref> It is at this arch that Dekker maintains that the return of the golden age is built on the premise that only when the virgin returns would the reign of Saturn return (2113&ndash;14).</p>
<p>As we can see from the aforesaid examples, Dekker&rsquo;s position in <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic> is glaringly different from his collaborators because his topical inventions and their &lsquo;further voices&rsquo; are intended to defend the changed place that is still valued culturally. In Dekker&rsquo;s Virgilian re-imaginings, Elizabeth is consistently the genius loci, but Dekker reassures the reader, &lsquo;It is no schism: be it so&rsquo; (296&ndash;97). Her divine presence in <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic> is meant to triumph over time in a needed time when more than &lsquo;40,000 [30,000]&rsquo; &lsquo;ghosts&rsquo; &lsquo;with the virulent poison of infection haue bin driuen out&rsquo; of the &lsquo;earthlie dwellings&rsquo; (C3<sup>r</sup>). From the ways in which Dekker uses Virgil in <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic> and <italic>The Wonderful Year</italic> (the diptych texts that harbour the cult of Elizabeth), we can see how Dekker uses Virgil&rsquo;s allusion, imagery, voices, and &lsquo;focalisation&rsquo; to &lsquo;add to, comment upon&rsquo; and &lsquo;question&rsquo; the &lsquo;implications of the epic voice&rsquo;. In post-Elizabeth Britain where the English had to reconfigure their political and cultural geography when &lsquo;the Map of a Countrey [is] so pittifullie distracted by the horror of change&rsquo; (B2<sup>v</sup>), Dekker&rsquo;s inventions are invested with a strong local identity and cultural self-definition that aim to claim a memorial space for Elizabethan England. <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic> is not only a sophisticated text noted for its multivocality and plurality of cultural values<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN31"><sup>31</sup></xref> but also a unique festival book that construes Virgil&rsquo;s approach to hard politics.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs159-FN32"><sup>32</sup></xref></p>

<fn id="gjs159-FN1"><p><sup>1</sup> Seven triumphal arches were constructed for the king&rsquo;s entry. Jonson was responsible for the pageants for the first arch (Londinium) located at Fenchurch and the seventh arch (Temple of Janus) at Temple Bar. The Italian and the Dutch communities presented the second and the third arches in Gracechurch Street and at the Royal Exchange. Dekker&rsquo;s inventions are the cancelled performance of the female genius loci (to be staged at Bishopsgate), and the pageants for the three triumphal arches, Nova Faelix Arabia in Soper Lane, Hortus Euporiae at Cheapside, and the New World Arch in Fleet Street. After the king&rsquo;s royal entry into London, Dekker was entrusted to document the entire event entitled <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment Given to King James I</italic> published in Edinburgh and London.

Dekker writes, &lsquo;Upon Thurseday it was treason to cry God saue King Iames of England, and upon Friday hye treason not to cry so&rsquo;. Elizabeth being the &lsquo;Courtier&rsquo;s treasure&rsquo;, &lsquo;Merchant&rsquo;s patronesse&rsquo;, &lsquo;Citizens mother&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Shepherds Goddesse&rsquo;, her death is like a &lsquo;tempest that shooke Cedars, terrified the tallest Pines and cleft in sunder euen the hardest hearts of Oake&rsquo;. Dekker asks, &lsquo;if such great trees were shaken, what thinke you became of the tender Eglantine and humble Hawthorne?&rsquo; Her passing is aestheticized as a falling &lsquo;leafe&rsquo; that &lsquo;went away in the Spring&rsquo;. Consistently appropriating Virgil&rsquo;s language to document the historical change, Dekker continues, &lsquo;the losse of a Queene was paid with the double interest of a King and Queen &hellip; the Cedar of her gouernment, who stood alone and bare no fruit, is changed now to an oliue vpon whose spreading branches grow both Kings and Queenes&rsquo; (B1<sup>r</sup>&ndash;B2<sup>v</sup>, B4<sup>r</sup>, C1<sup>r</sup>&ndash;C1<sup>v</sup>).</p></fn>

<fn id="gjs159-FN21"><p><sup>21</sup> Dekker seems to have consulted Virgil&rsquo;s eulogy of Italy (that claims that neither the ancient civilizations of Turkey, India, and Araby, nor Media&rsquo;s groves and Hermus&rsquo; land whose mud is gold would rival the glory of Italy, <italic>Georgics</italic>, II, 136&ndash;39) when he wrote the Ode to Britain (38&ndash;69) for <italic>The Magnificent Entertainment</italic>, in which Dekker asserts that none of the seven wonders of the world could rival the glory of Britain.</p></fn>
