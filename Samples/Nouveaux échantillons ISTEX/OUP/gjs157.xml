<body><p>THE Old English poem known as <italic>(The) Seasons for Fasting</italic> was printed for the first time in 1942 by Dobbie in volume six of The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN1"><sup>1</sup></xref> His edition relied on a then-recently discovered transcription made in 1562 by the antiquary Laurence Nowell. For his part, Nowell had copied the poem from a later tenth-/early eleventh-century book from Winchester that would thereafter enter Sir Robert Cotton&rsquo;s library as manuscript Otho B.xi. When the Asburnham House fire of 1731 destroyed most of the Otho manuscript, Nowell&rsquo;s transcription (now London, British Library, Additional 43703) became the most complete surviving witness to the poem, although its value as such went unrecognized for centuries.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
<p>The medieval exemplar must have had its share of scribal errors. From what we know of Nowell&rsquo;s habits as a copyist, moreover, he almost certainly added his own transcription mistakes and deliberate alterations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> Early scholarship on <italic>Seasons for Fasting</italic> therefore concentrated on matters of textual criticism, and, before long, Dobbie&rsquo;s text and notes were trailed by a long list of important corrections and suggestions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref> Studies of the poem&rsquo;s sources lagged, meanwhile, in part because early critics could summon little enthusiasm for the subject matter of <italic>Seasons for Fasting</italic>. Its almost 230 surviving verses treat the calendrical reckoning of the four Ember Fasts (lines 1&ndash;102) and the biblical precedents for the forty-day fast of Lent (lines 103&ndash;83). A final section (lines 184&ndash;230) begins a scathing critique of clergy who fail to observe the church&rsquo;s ordained fasts, before the text breaks off incomplete.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN5"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
<p>If many readers have been put off by this &lsquo;homiletic&rsquo; content, others have faulted the &lsquo;prosaic&rsquo; tendencies of the verse (i.e. the poet&rsquo;s use of vocabulary normally restricted to Old English prose).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN6"><sup>6</sup></xref> A minority of critics, however, have argued for the interest of the text both on its own terms and as a window on late Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical culture.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN7"><sup>7</sup></xref> The most articulate exponent of this view is Mary P. Richards, whose interest in the substance of the poem has led to a clearer demonstration of its links with various late Anglo-Saxon homiletic and legislative writings. Richards has explored these connections most effectively for the first two parts of the poem, namely those on the dates of the Ember Fasts and on the biblical precedents for Lent.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN8"><sup>8</sup></xref> But the final part of the work as it survives&mdash;the attack on corrupt churchmen (lines 184&ndash;230)&mdash;has yielded fewer definite rewards to source-hunters. Richards and others have rightly compared the poet&rsquo;s depiction of lax clergy to broadly similar complaints expressed in canonistic and legal texts from the period, but the resemblances are of a general kind.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN9"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
<p>Otherwise, only one literary source has been plausibly identified for this part of the poem. In lines 206&ndash;7, the author encourages his real or imagined lay audience to imitate the wholesome teachings that clergy say, not the wickedness that they do. To reinforce the point, a cryptic allegory follows: &lsquo;Drince he [<italic>scil.</italic> the sinful clergyman] him &thorn;&aelig;t drofe; duge hlutter &thorn;e / w&aelig;ter of wege&mdash;&thorn;&aelig;t is wuldres lar&rsquo; (Let him drink the turbid pool; let clear water from the current&mdash;that is the doctrine of glory&mdash;work good in you).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN10"><sup>10</sup></xref> The importance of these lines for source-study was not evident at first; Dobbie had encumbered 206b with a drastic emendation that Sisam and Leslie quickly showed to be unnecessary.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN11"><sup>11</sup></xref> Their support for Nowell&rsquo;s original reading (the one that I quote above) was soon confirmed by Schabram and Whitbread, who identified as the source of the poet&rsquo;s image an exegesis of Ezechiel 34:18&ndash;19 found in Gregory the Great&rsquo;s <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> i.2.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN12"><sup>12</sup></xref> The Old English passage has adapted the allegory subtly: where Gregory states that immoral pastors themselves drink the clear water but muddy it for their flocks, the &lsquo;you&rsquo; whom the poem encourages to drink &lsquo;clear water &hellip; [which] is the doctrine of glory&rsquo; is the lay addressee (cf. 202 <italic>folces mann</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN13"><sup>13</sup></xref> By these changes the poet alters the emphases of the Latin original, focusing sympathy on the lay flock and flattering their virtue at the clergy&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>It seems to have escaped notice that a second passage, from later in Gregory&rsquo;s <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic>, is the most likely source for several lines in the poem shortly before those concerning the <italic>hluttor w&aelig;ter</italic>. The lines at issue are 195 through 199, but to provide more context I begin quoting from 192:
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>&THORN;onne is &thorn;earf micel&emsp;&thorn;eoda m&aelig;nium</p>
<p>&thorn;&aelig;t &thorn;a sacerdos&emsp;sylfe ne gyltan,</p>
<p>ne on leahtrum hiora&emsp;ligegen to f&aelig;ste.</p>
<p>Hwa m&aelig;g &thorn;yngian&emsp;&thorn;reale hwilcum</p>
<p>wi&thorn; his arwesan,&emsp;gyf he him &aelig;rur h&aelig;f&eth;</p>
<p>bitere onbolgen,&emsp;and &thorn;&aelig;s bote ne de&eth;,</p>
<p>ac &thorn;a &aelig;bylig&thorn;e&emsp;ealdere wrohte</p>
<p>d&aelig;g-hwamlice&emsp;d&aelig;dum niwa&eth;?<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN14"><sup>14</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>
The final two lines quoted have occasioned some disagreement. Dobbie and Holthausen construed <italic>wrohte</italic> in 198b as a verb (i.e. <italic>worhte</italic> with metathesis), and the latter took <italic>ealdere</italic> as dative singular of <italic>ealdor</italic> &lsquo;lord, ruler&rsquo;. Sisam made better sense of the line, construing <italic>ealdere wrohte</italic> as a genitive or dative (feminine) noun phrase &lsquo;of/for (the) old injury&rsquo;, dependent on accusative <italic>&aelig;bylig&thorn;e</italic> &lsquo;anger&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN15"><sup>15</sup></xref> Incorporating Sisam&rsquo;s view, an idiomatic translation would be:
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>The multitudes of people therefore have great need that priests, for their part, should not offend or remain too set in their vices. Who will be able to intercede on behalf of any servant before his lord if he [the intercessor] himself has already bitterly angered him [the lord] and does not atone for it, but instead, by his actions, renews daily the [lord&rsquo;s] anger at that past injury?<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN16"><sup>16</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>
The available editions and commentaries shed no light on the backgrounds to this passage, and the one parallel indicated by the <italic>Fontes Anglo-Saxonici</italic> database is not very close.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN17"><sup>17</sup></xref> The most probable source is in fact again the first book of Gregory&rsquo;s <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic>. The context there is Gregory&rsquo;s explanation that pastors must live blameless lives because doing so makes the pastor <italic>familiaris</italic> &lsquo;on intimate terms&rsquo; with God and thus an empowered intercessor. To illustrate the point, and to contrast the effective with the immoral (and hence counterproductive) intercessor, Gregory introduces a vivid analogy:
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>Si enim fortasse quis ueniat, ut pro se ad intercedendum nos apud potentem quempiam uirum, qui sibi iratus, nobis uero est incognitus, ducat, protinus respondemus: Ad intercedendum uenire non possumus, quia familiaritatis eius notitiam non habemus. Si ergo homo apud hominem de quo minime praesumit fieri intercessor erubescit, qua mente apud Deum intercessionis locum pro populo arripit, qui familiarem se eius grati&aelig; esse per uitae meritum nescit? Aut ab eo quomodo aliis ueniam postulat, qui utrum sibi sit placatus ignorat? Qua in re adhuc aliud est sollicitius formidandum, ne qui placare posse iram creditur, hanc ipse ex proprio reatu mereatur. Cuncti enim liquide nouimus, quia cum is qui displicet ad intercedendum mittitur, irati animus ad deteriora prouocatur.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN18"><sup>18</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>(If a person comes to fetch me to intercede on his behalf before some powerful man who is angry at that person and yet unknown to me, right away I will reply: &lsquo;I cannot come intercede because I have no relationship of familiarity with that [powerful] man.&rsquo; If one therefore feels embarrassed before another human being with whom he does not presume to intercede, by what reasoning does a man act on the people&rsquo;s behalf as their intercessor before God if that man does not know himself to be, by the merit of his life, on familiar terms with God&rsquo;s favor? Or how will a man seek pardon for others if he is uncertain whether [God] is well-satisfied with him? In this regard, there is something else to be dreaded even more anxiously&mdash;namely that the one whom we trust to placate wrath may himself be deserving of wrath, owing to his own guilt. For we all know full well that when a person dispatched to intercede causes displeasure, the temper of the already angered party is provoked to even worse degrees.)</p></disp-quote>
Gregory&rsquo;s example dramatizes the social world of the late antique bishop as a powerful patron, surrounded by clients whose welfare could depend on their pastor&rsquo;s <italic>familiaritas</italic> with higher civil and ecclesiastical authorities.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN19"><sup>19</sup></xref> Just as in his passage on the &lsquo;clear water&rsquo; of doctrine, however, the <italic>Seasons-</italic>poet has modified the emphases of Gregory&rsquo;s original. In the poem, concern shifts away from the potential awkwardness and guilt that attend the patron&ndash;client relationship from the pastor&rsquo;s viewpoint (which is also Gregory&rsquo;s). The poet drops altogether the theme of <italic>familiaritas</italic> and emphasizes instead how the plight of the flock is worsened by pastors whose immorality exacerbates their lord&rsquo;s (or Lord&rsquo;s) anger. Gregory acknowledges that some pastors may fall short, but his programme of instruction in the <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> as a whole assumes that most will not. The poet&rsquo;s satirical and polemical aims, on the other hand, have less use for such optimism.</p>
<p>The identification of a second substantial borrowing by the poet from the <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> raises two further questions. First, does any evidence suggest that the poem depends at either moment on the Old English prose translation of Gregory&rsquo;s work often attributed to King Alfred? This question has received passing attention in earlier analyses of lines 206&ndash;7 as a reflex of <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> i.2 (on the &lsquo;clear water&rsquo; of teaching). Richards has stated that those lines &lsquo;may have been inspired by a passage from the [Old] English translation&rsquo; of Gregory&rsquo;s text. But she does not consider the question further, merely citing Schabram&rsquo;s article that first demonstrated in detail the poet&rsquo;s reliance on the <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN20"><sup>20</sup></xref> In addition to quoting the Latin from <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> i.2, Schabram&rsquo;s study did indeed also quote the corresponding sections both from the Old English prose translation and from the Old English interlinear gloss to the <italic>Liber scintillarum</italic>, where the relevant passage from Gregory&rsquo;s text appears in cap. 32 (<italic>De doctoribus siue rectoribus</italic>). Schabram did not go so far as to claim, however, that either Old English version influenced the poet; he seems to have included the quotations rather to illustrate the availability of Gregory&rsquo;s water metaphor in vernacular contexts and to sample how other translators rendered the passage into Old English.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN21"><sup>21</sup></xref> Some correspondences of wording do appear among the poem, the earlier prose translation and the gloss. Thus we find collocations of <italic>hluttor</italic> with <italic>w&aelig;ter</italic> in all three; and Gregory&rsquo;s verb <italic>perturbare</italic> (cf. forms of <italic>turbare</italic> from Ezechiel 34:19) is answered by the noun <italic>drofe</italic> at <italic>Seasons</italic> 206 and forms of the verb <italic>gedrefan</italic> in the prose translation and the <italic>Liber scintillarum</italic> gloss.</p>
<p>On review, then, there are some similarities, but of a kind that could just as easily have arisen independently in three unrelated translations of the same Latin material. This negative conclusion now seems all the more likely in view of the newly recognized dependence of lines 195&ndash;9 on <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> i.10. In this case, the relevant source passage does not appear at all in the <italic>Liber scintillarum</italic>, so the Old English gloss to that work may be left out of comparison. The entire Latin passage is, however, translated in the late ninth-century prose version of the <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic>:
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>Hw&aelig;t wenstu nu, gif hwelc forworht monn cym&eth; &amp; bitt urne hwelcne &eth;&aelig;t we hine l&aelig;den to sumum ricum menn &amp; him ge&eth;ingien, &eth;onne he wi&eth; hine iersa&eth;?

<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>(Now what will you expect if any criminal comes and asks one of us that we lead him to some powerful person and intercede for him when [the powerful person] is angry at him? If he [the powerful one] is not known to me, nor is any person of his household, I will very quickly answer him [the petitioner] and say: &lsquo;I cannot perform that mediation; I am not so familiar with him.&rsquo; If we therefore feel shame to say such [words of intercession] to people we do not know, how dare we say such to God? Or how dare any man undertake the office of mediating for others with God [when that man] does not know himself to be familiar with God through the merits of his life? Or how will he dare intercede for others, not knowing whether he himself has been interceded for? He may fear causing greater anger on account of his transgressions. We all know that, among men, if one asks another to intercede on his behalf with another [third] man who is also angry with [the intercessor], he [the petitioner? the intercessor?] enrages the wrathful temper and incites worse anger.)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN23"><sup>23</sup></xref></p></disp-quote>
This follows Gregory closely, although the pronomial references grow so confusing by the end that it is not absolutely certain that the translator understood the Latin, or that an Anglo-Saxon audience could have followed what Gregory meant. The dynamics of <italic>familiaritas</italic>&mdash;a theme that, as we have seen, the poet of <italic>Seasons for Fasting</italic> largely suppresses&mdash;is conveyed plainly by the prose translator and even expanded in order to encompass not just the powerful (<italic>rice</italic>) man but members of his household (<italic>hired</italic>). At the level of word-choice as well, few correspondences stand out between the poem and prose: only <italic>&thorn;yngian</italic> at <italic>Seasons</italic> 195 mirrors forms of <italic>(ge)&eth;ingian</italic> in the prose (although the latter also uses <italic>&aelig;rendian</italic> in a similar sense). All in all, more striking are the differences between the poet and the early West-Saxon translator: the two have imagined Gregory&rsquo;s indefinite petitioner (<italic>si </italic>&hellip; <italic>quis</italic>) in starkly divergent ways, the poet envisioning a faultless and vulnerable <italic>&thorn;r&aelig;l</italic> (195b), the prose-author a condemned criminal (<italic>hwelc forworht monn</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN24"><sup>24</sup></xref> The poet&rsquo;s more sympathetic regard for the petitioner&rsquo;s situation is consistent with his championing of the beleaguered flock against their corrupt pastors. Likewise, the poet&rsquo;s terms of lordship (<italic>arwesan</italic> 196) and reconciliation (<italic>bote</italic> 197) suit his religious-allegorical purposes nicely but have no correspondence in the prose. The prose, moreover, uses an entirely different vocabulary of anger (<italic>ierre</italic> and forms of the verb <italic>iersian</italic>; also <italic>gegrema&eth;</italic>; cf. <italic>onbolgen</italic> and <italic>&aelig;bylig&thorn;e</italic> in <italic>Seasons</italic> 197&ndash;8).</p>
<p>It seems, then, the poet was almost certainly <italic>not</italic> relying on the early West-Saxon translation for this passage; or rather, if he did know that version, he ignored both its wording and the slant of its interpretation. And if the poem does not reflect the influence of the Alfredian-era translation in lines 195&ndash;9, it is reasonable to conclude, in the absence of strong contrary evidence, that the same is probably true for the adaptation of Gregory in lines 206&ndash;7 as well. In sum, if the poet was relying on any prior Old English version of these two passages, that version does not seem to have survived.</p>
<p>Turning back, finally, to the possibility that the Latin <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> was the poet&rsquo;s source, we find that a different question remains: did the poet know Gregory&rsquo;s treatise directly or merely from quotations of it embedded in some other text? The truth here is probably irrecoverable, but the question is worth framing, for it bears on arguments about the poem&rsquo;s structure and origins. Whitbread briefly suggested that the author&rsquo;s use of the <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> in lines 206&ndash;7 (the water metaphor) created a link, of sorts, between the first and third major divisions in the poem. That is, in the first part of <italic>Seasons for Fasting</italic>, Gregory the Great is mentioned by name twice as author of the Anglo-Saxon custom for calculating the spring and summer Ember Fasts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN25"><sup>25</sup></xref> Whitbread&rsquo;s notion that Gregory&rsquo;s prominence in the first part of the work inspired the poet to turn to the <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> when attacking corrupt pastors in the last part is appealing but tenuous. Neither of the (now) two definite echoes of Gregory&rsquo;s treatise names the patristic author, nor, so far as I can tell, do other lines of the poem show clear debts to the <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic>. Indeed, the subordination of Gregory&rsquo;s authority to the poet&rsquo;s topical concerns near the end of the text should perhaps encourage us to seek an intermediate source that follows a similar strategy.</p>
<p>The poet certainly could have encountered the Gregorian passages in their original context, but they were also available through indirect channels. For instance, as mentioned above, the Gregorian source for lines 206&ndash;7 (<italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> i.2) was transmitted in the <italic>Liber scintillarum</italic>, a popular anthology compiled by the monk Defensor of Ligug&eacute; around 700.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN26"><sup>26</sup></xref> Given the general character of the last part of <italic>Seasons for Fasting</italic>, however, and its resonances with Anglo-Saxon canonistic and legal writings,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN27"><sup>27</sup></xref> I speculate that an ascetic anthology such as the <italic>Liber scintillarum</italic> is a less probable intermediary than another influential work, namely the so-called <italic>Institutio canonicorum</italic>. This text was produced in connection with the Council of Aachen (August&ndash;September 816) and aimed at reform of Frankish secular clergy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN28"><sup>28</sup></xref> Among the quotations of patristic, conciliar, and canonical authorities that make up the complete <italic>Institutio canonicorum</italic>, we find Gregory&rsquo;s <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> i.10 (the source for <italic>Seasons</italic> 195&ndash;9) and i.2 (the source for <italic>Seasons</italic> 206&ndash;7) quoted at length in chapters 13 and 27, respectively, of the Aachen text.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN29"><sup>29</sup></xref> The additional fact that both the poem and the Aachen Council present the two Gregorian passages in the same order, reversing their sequence in the original <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic>, is suggestive though hardly conclusive. The <italic>Institutio canonicorum</italic> is a sprawling work, wherein our two Gregorian passages are separated from each other by lengthy matter from which the <italic>Seasons</italic>-poet does not draw. On the other hand, the <italic>Institutio</italic> as a whole does offer plenty of the kind of material&mdash;including prohibitions against clergy visiting taverns (Canons 60 and 90) or violating universal fasts (Canon 69)&mdash;that underlies the Anglo-Saxon canonistic and legal texts that most resemble the last section of <italic>Seasons for Fasting.</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN30"><sup>30</sup></xref> The possibility that the poet encountered the Gregorian passages from the <italic>Regula pastoralis</italic> in the Aachen <italic>Institutio canonicorum</italic>, or in some epitome derived from it, would explain the easy blending of patristic imagery with canonistic prescription in the last segment of the poem. Additionally, the form of the Aachen text bears on the question of whether the poet believed Gregory to be the authority not just for the English reckoning of Ember Fasts but for the homiletic ideas paraphrased in verses 195&ndash;9 and 206&ndash;7: the <italic>Institutio</italic> cites its patristic sources by name, and the headings for its chapters that concern us (capp. 13 and 27) both begin &lsquo;Gregorii de pastoribus &hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is one final implication of the scenario being sketched here. Reception of the two Gregorian passages through a compilation indebted to the 816 Council of Aachen also strengthens the hypothesis that <italic>Seasons for Fasting</italic> originated in &lsquo;reformist&rsquo; circles of the late Anglo-Saxon church. More specifically, the author may have had access to many of the same sources as underlie Archbishop Wulfstan&rsquo;s writings and the manuscripts of reference-material that reflect, at varying removes, Wulfstan&rsquo;s interests.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN31"><sup>31</sup></xref> Among those materials were portions, at least, of the <italic>Institutio canonicorum</italic>, a work whose influence on both Wulfstan and his contemporary, &AElig;lfric the homilist, has been recognized for some time. The extracts from the Aachen <italic>Institutio</italic> preserved in Wulfstanian manuscripts are not very extensive, nor do they happen to include our particular passages from Gregory.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs157-FN32"><sup>32</sup></xref> But behind them may have stood, somewhere, a more complete text of the <italic>Institutio</italic> available in late tenth- or early eleventh-century England and known to the anonymous poet of <italic>Seasons for Fasting</italic>.</p>
