<body><p>GEORGE PEELE&rsquo;s <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic> was entered in the Registers of the Stationers&rsquo; Company in 1595.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN1"><sup>1</sup></xref> The first and only known edition of the play was subsequently printed in quarto by the end of the year.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> It was once argued that the mention of a dramatic company printed on its title page was &lsquo;designed to attract the reader, and its reliability is suspect&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> Recent critics and editors of the play, however, are unanimous in accepting the phrase &lsquo;played by the Queenes Ma-&vert;iesties players&rsquo; literally and without suspicion.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
<p>The play, not divided into acts or into scenes, consists of only 1,170 lines of verse and prose. The brevity of the text constituted the main topic of discussion with regard to the nature of the printer&rsquo;s copy-text. A number of textual critics and editors, in particular, W. W. Greg, Harold Jenkins, Frank S. Hook, and Patricia Binnie, contributed to a long, complicated history of the analysis of the text from 1908 to 1980.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN5"><sup>5</sup></xref> The discussion on the provenance of the copy-text culminated in 1984 when Paul Werstine concluded that there is good reason to believe in the possibility that &lsquo;a theatrical manuscript, perhaps an abridgement, stands behind <italic>The Old Wives Tale</italic> quarto&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN6"><sup>6</sup></xref> Although neither the arguments of Greg and Jenkins nor the discussions by Hook and Binnie offered anything besides mere conjecture, Werstine&rsquo;s analysis, drawing on multiple textual clues and evidence, has since been considered the most logical and persuasive. In 1996, Charles Whitworth endorsed Werstine&rsquo;s theory when he proposed, in the introduction to his edition, that the text, of foul papers origin, was used as a performance script, perhaps subsequently cut down for a touring production.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN7"><sup>7</sup></xref> Werstine&rsquo;s thesis has since stood unchallenged. It is reasonable, accordingly, to conclude that the text of <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic> was printed from a theatrical play-book deriving from foul papers, perhaps abridged.</p>
<p>As long ago as 1933, Harold M. Dowling suggested that the unique speech prefix &lsquo;<italic>Simon</italic>&rsquo; on C4<sup>v</sup> of the play may be &lsquo;a relic of the prompt copy and as such may refer to the actor&rsquo; who played the role at a performance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN8"><sup>8</sup></xref> This is the only speech prefix in the play to replace the usual &lsquo;<italic>Churchwarden</italic>&rsquo;, though the warden subsequently reveals his name &lsquo;<italic>Steeuen Loache</italic>&rsquo; on D1<sup>v</sup>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN9"><sup>9</sup></xref> Werstine argues that, in the case of <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic>, where the authorial manuscript was abridged and used as the prompt-book, an actor&rsquo;s name might remain intact, for &lsquo;dramatic manuscripts abridged and probably annotated for the theater retain many stage directions and speech headings characteristic of the author&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN10"><sup>10</sup></xref> Dowling added to his conjecture further by delving into contemporary theatre history; he identified &lsquo;<italic>Simon</italic>&rsquo; with John Symons, the actor and tumbler, who joined the Queen&rsquo;s Men after Richard Tarlton&rsquo;s death in 1588. Symons is known to have stayed for only a short time; in 1589, the town account of Nottingham recorded &lsquo;Symons and his companie, being the Quenes players&rsquo;, but he subsequently joined the Admiral&rsquo;s Men by the court season of 1588&ndash;9.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN11"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
<p>Given more recent and precise information of the Queen&rsquo;s Men personnel than what was known in 1933, however, one would, unavoidably <italic>contra</italic> Dowling, deter from identifying &lsquo;<italic>Simon</italic>&rsquo; with John Symons, although, regrettably, some editors of the play have still accepted Dowling&rsquo;s dubious identification unquestioningly in the introduction or the commentary of their modern editions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN12"><sup>12</sup></xref> None but only one Elizabethan player currently known to theatre historians was both active in the 1590s and called &lsquo;Simon&rsquo; by his surname or forename; Simon Burde was a member of the Children of Paul&rsquo;s in 1550s, while Simon Goodale, son of Thomas Goodale who was &lsquo;a player of Enterludes&rsquo;, was born in 1594 but died in the following year.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN13"><sup>13</sup></xref> The speech prefix &lsquo;<italic>Simon</italic>&rsquo; is more likely, though not demonstrably evident, to be representing Simon Jewell than John Symons, as Scott McMillin and Sally-Beth MacLean proposed.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN14"><sup>14</sup></xref> Jewell was a sharer and player of the Queen&rsquo;s Men who played <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic>. His will, first discovered by Mary Edmond in 1974,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN15"><sup>15</sup></xref> is dated 19 August 1592, and his death caused by plague seems to have followed shortly after it was completed, for he was buried at St Leonard Shoreditch on 21 August. Jewell&rsquo;s will was finally administered by his colleagues on 23 August.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN16"><sup>16</sup></xref> His affiliation with the theatrical company is evidenced by the appearance of the names, in his will, of such eminent and minor players as &lsquo;mr Ihonson&rsquo; (i.e. William Johnson), &lsquo;Roberte Nicholls&rsquo;, &lsquo;mr Smithe&rsquo; (William Smith), and &lsquo;mr Cooke&rsquo; (Lionel Cooke), all of whom are known, or are believed to have been, members of the Queen&rsquo;s Men.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN17"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
<p>The appearance of an actor&rsquo;s name was a fairly common phenomenon in contemporary dramatic texts. Not only the author but an annotator, or a book-keeper, might, not infrequently, inscribe an actor&rsquo;s name in the authorial foul papers or a theatrical manuscript. Instances abound of speech prefixes replaced by the actor&rsquo;s name. In Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays performed by the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s players, one may recollect &lsquo;<italic>Kemp</italic>&rsquo; (William Kemp) and &lsquo;<italic>Cowley</italic>&rsquo; (Richard Cowley) printed as the speech prefix on G3<sup>v</sup>&ndash;G4<sup>v</sup> of the first quarto of <italic>Much Ado about Nothing</italic> (1600). John Sincler&rsquo;s name, &lsquo;<italic>Sincklo</italic>.&rsquo;, appears on S3<sup>r</sup> in the Folio text of <italic>The Taming of the Shrew</italic> (1623). Stage-directions too can be affected. Kemp&rsquo;s name appears in the stage-direction, &lsquo;<italic>Enter Will Kemp</italic>.&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<italic>Enter Peter</italic>.&rsquo;, on K3<sup>v</sup> of the second quarto of <italic>Romeo and Juliet</italic> (1599), while Sincler was referred to again in &lsquo;<italic>Enter Sincklo and three or foure officers</italic>&rsquo; on K3<sup>v</sup> of the first quarto of <italic>2 Henry IV</italic> (1600). According to Allison Gaw, of the extant Shakespearean play-texts, references of this kind are scattered through seven editions of six plays.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN18"><sup>18</sup></xref> To Gaw&rsquo;s list, one may wish to add Shakespeare&rsquo;s co-authored play, <italic>Two Noble Kinsmen</italic> (1634), where two players, &lsquo;<italic>Curtis</italic>&rsquo; (Curtis Greville) and &lsquo;<italic>T. Tucke</italic>&rsquo; (Thomas Tuckfield), are mentioned on I4<sup>v</sup> and L4<sup>v</sup>. Of the early modern printed play-texts published in 1500&ndash;1660, a character with the name &lsquo;Simon&rsquo; appears, either as the speech prefix or in the stage-direction, in a total of twelve plays.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN19"><sup>19</sup></xref> Of the twelve, <italic>The Taming of A Shrew</italic> is the only other play whose conjectured date of performance, 1592, falls within the years when Jewell was alive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN20"><sup>20</sup></xref> In <italic>A Shrew</italic>, when Sly asks the Lord &lsquo;Whats thy name?&rsquo;, he replies to Sly that his name is &lsquo;Simon&rsquo; (A4<sup>r</sup>). In the following scene, the second stage-direction reads &lsquo;Enter Simon, <italic>Alphonsus</italic>, and his &vert; three daughters.&rsquo; (B1<sup>r</sup>). The title page of the first quarto of the play, however, reads &lsquo;As it was sundry times acted by the &vert; <italic>Right honorable the Earle of</italic> &vert; Pembrook his seruants.&rsquo; As there is no firm basis on which to doubt the ascription, this would evidently render the possibility of Jewell&rsquo;s appearance in <italic>A Shrew</italic> remote. McMillin and MacLean had no reason to include the play in the Queen&rsquo;s Men stock.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN21"><sup>21</sup></xref> <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic> is the only extant play where one can detect the trace of Jewell as an active player.</p>
<p>Whether the speech prefix &lsquo;<italic>Simon</italic>&rsquo; in <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic> was inscribed in the authorial manuscript by Peele, or, later on, in a theatrical script by the book-keeper or an annotator, we cannot be certain. Common sense suggests, however, that it would serve no purpose to inscribe his name after his retirement or his death. It is, therefore, reasonable to think that the inscription of his name must have occurred while Jewell was still alive and active, and that his name was inscribed in ink before the end of August 1592. The appearance of his name in the 1595 quarto, long after his death, could simply be interpreted as a reproduction of the original manuscript.</p>
<p>The conclusion that we have reached, in turn, leads to a fresh question concerning the date of composition of <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic>. The question is far from agreed on by the critics. The play is currently believed to have been written either between <italic>c</italic>. 1588 and 1594,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN22"><sup>22</sup></xref> or &lsquo;almost certainly 1589&ndash;90&rsquo;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN23"><sup>23</sup></xref> or between <italic>c</italic>. 1591 and April 1595,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN24"><sup>24</sup></xref> or &lsquo;Not earlier than 1591 or later than 1594&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN25"><sup>25</sup></xref> It has already become evident from the discussion above that its <italic>terminus ad quem</italic> was August 1592 when Jewell died. The key to determining the <italic>terminus a quo</italic> is Robert Greene&rsquo;s play, <italic>The History of Orlando Furioso</italic>, entered first on 7 December 1593 and printed in 1594,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN26"><sup>26</sup></xref> from which, as all recent editors agree, Peele borrowed in <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic> a single, almost identical passage, as well as the magician&rsquo;s name &lsquo;Sacrapant&rsquo;, a variation of &lsquo;Sacripant&rsquo; in Greene&rsquo;s text.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN27"><sup>27</sup></xref> This fact is enough to show that Peele&rsquo;s play was written after <italic>Orlando</italic>.</p>
<p>Discussion on the date of the composition of <italic>Orlando</italic> currently reaches two different conclusions, to which most of the modern editors and critics of <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic> have kept being blind. First, Greg suggested in 1922 that Greene&rsquo;s play was based on Sir John Harington&rsquo;s translation of Ludovico Ariosto&rsquo;s <italic>Orlando Furioso</italic> printed in 1591.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN28"><sup>28</sup></xref> The book is known to have been entered on 26 February 1590/91.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN29"><sup>29</sup></xref> In addition, Greg detected that the engraved title page &lsquo;contains a medallion portrait of the translator with an inscription of 1 August the same year&rsquo;, that is, &lsquo;<italic>Primo August anno Domini 1591</italic>.&rsquo; Greg concluded that, as &lsquo;There appears no reason to suppose that Harington&rsquo;s work circulated in manuscript&rsquo;, it seems &lsquo;highly probable that Greene&rsquo;s attempt at dramatizing the story of Orlando&rsquo;s madness was the direct outcome of the appearance of the English Ariosto, and was undertaken in the early autumn of 1591&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN30"><sup>30</sup></xref> Second, Martin Wiggins most recently argues that Greg&rsquo;s suggestion depends upon nothing more than the omission of a terminal &lsquo;-e&rsquo; in a proper name, which is not uncommon in Elizabethan orthography. He states, instead, that, in the text of Greene&rsquo;s <italic>Orlando</italic>, there are indications pointing to his use of the Italian original, especially a specific verbal debt to the Italian text of Canto 27 in the play&rsquo;s Scene 4. Wiggins finally concludes that <italic>Orlando</italic> was composed in the winter of 1590&ndash;1 before Shrovetide, which was mid-February and before Harington&rsquo;s version was registered.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN31"><sup>31</sup></xref> To conclude, on the basis of the two supposed dates of the composition of <italic>Orlando</italic>, the existing scholarship suggests that the <italic>terminus a quo</italic> of <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic> would be between mid-February and the autumn or winter of 1591.</p>
<p>In the third edition of <italic>Annals of English Drama 975&ndash;1700</italic>, <italic>The Old Wives&rsquo; Tale</italic> is listed in the section of &lsquo;1590&rsquo; with the limits of &lsquo;<italic>c</italic>. 1588<italic>&ndash;</italic>1594&rsquo;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN32"><sup>32</sup></xref> But the speech prefix in question seems to indicate that the date of Peele&rsquo;s play fall within an ever narrower range of years, that is, between mid-February 1591 when Greene&rsquo;s manuscript of <italic>Orlando</italic> became available to Peele, and August 1592 when &lsquo;<italic>Simon</italic>&rsquo; Jewell died.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs156-FN33"><sup>33</sup></xref></p>
