<body><p>GUILDHALL LIBRARY, London, St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral MS 25124 is a collection of seventy-seven original thirteenth- and fourteenth-century letters of indulgence issued to finance the rebuilding of St Paul&rsquo;s after fires in 1087 and 1136 destroyed the Saxon church and work on a Norman replacement. One of the most ambitious construction projects of the era, the cathedral was not finished until 1327 and attracted a wealth of such privileges, particularly in the mid-thirteenth century, when work had progressed sufficiently for the church to be dedicated on 13 January 1241 and a fresh phase of construction launched with a generous indulgence of Innocent IV (1252).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN1"><sup>1</sup></xref> The bulk of the indulgences collected in 25124 were awarded by English and Welsh bishops, though Scottish, Irish, and continental sees are also represented. The collection was catalogued and arranged in chronological order by William Sparrow Simpson, minor canon and cathedral librarian from 1862 to 1897, who also supplied an annotated list and edited seven examples from the series in a selection of documents illustrating the history of St Paul&rsquo;s published by the Camden Society. Originally housed in the cathedral library, the collection was transferred along with the remainder of the St Paul&rsquo;s archive to the Guildhall Library in 1980.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
<p>The first and, in Sparrow Simpson&rsquo;s judgement, the earliest document in the series, 25124/1, was issued at St Paul&rsquo;s by a bishop of Bangor identified, as was common in English episcopal acts, only by his initial, &lsquo;R&rsquo;, and dated to St Lucy&rsquo;s day (13 December) &lsquo;in the fourth year of our pontificate&rsquo;. Sparrow Simpson identified the author as Robert of Shrewsbury, bishop of Bangor from 1197 to 1212, and dated the indulgence to 1201.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> To my knowledge, the attribution and dating have not been challenged in the more recent literature.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref> There are, however, two other possible candidates: Rotoland, sub-prior of the Cistercian abbey of Aberconwy and bishop of Bangor from approximately 1191 to 1196; and Master Richard, archdeacon of Bangor, who was elected in 1236, consecrated in 1237, and occupied the see until his death in 1267.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN5"><sup>5</sup></xref> The contention of this note is that for the reasons outlined below 25124/1 should in fact be dated to 1240 and attributed to Bishop Richard.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the seal attached to 25124/1 is damaged and therefore provides no firm evidence for the date and attribution of the act. It exhibits the standard iconographic and physical features of a thirteenth-century Welsh episcopal seal: in green wax, it measures approximately 40 &times; 33 mm, is in a vesical (pointed-oval) form, and is attached by a double queue, a parchment tag passed through an incision in the fold at the foot of the document.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN6"><sup>6</sup></xref> The obverse depicts a bishop in eucharistic vestments under a canopy, right hand raised in blessing, holding in his left a pastoral staff turned inwards; the reverse depicts what appears to be a human figure on the right and a sphere to the left. The legends, of which only the word &lsquo;sigillum&rsquo; on the obverse is clearly decipherable, are in the &lsquo;Lombardic&rsquo; capitals customarily used on episcopal seals in the first half of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>The text of the act, of which a fresh transcription is printed below, is in most respects typical of the rising tide of indulgences produced in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries not only to solicit alms for the construction of churches, but also to endow religious foundations, to foster devotions, to relieve the poor, and even to build bridges, roads, and harbours. In the disposition, the bishop of Bangor extends to the faithful of his own jurisdiction who contribute to the St Paul&rsquo;s building fund, and to any other donors whose diocesans ratify his indulgence, the relaxation of forty days&rsquo; &lsquo;enjoined penance&rsquo;&mdash;a penalty such as fasting or pilgrimage imposed by the penitent&rsquo;s confessor&mdash;on condition of sincere contrition and confession.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN7"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
<p>It is significant that the <italic>arenga</italic>, or preamble, of 25124/1 employs the &lsquo;Quoniam ut ait&rsquo; formula, which is constructed around two quotations from Paul&rsquo;s second letter to the Corinthians (5:10 and 9:6):
<disp-quote content-type="extract"><p>Since, as the Apostle says, &lsquo;we shall all stand before the judgement seat of Jesus Christ to receive according as we have done in the flesh, whether good or ill,&rsquo; it befits us to anticipate the day of the final harvest by works of mercy and, mindful of things eternal, to sow on earth what, when the Lord rewards us, we, standing fast in hope and faith, may reap in heaven in increased yield, for &lsquo;he who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully shall also bountifully reap&rsquo; eternal life.</p></disp-quote>
Employed in papal acts as early as Eugene III (1145&ndash;53), the formula was recommended by canon 62 of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) as a model for bishops licensing the seekers (<italic>quaestores</italic>) of alms and pardoners who advertised indulgences.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN8"><sup>8</sup></xref> Innocent III (1198&ndash;1216) granted an indulgence in the &lsquo;Quoniam ut ait&rsquo; form in favour of the hospital of SS James and John in Aynho, Northamptonshire, during the closing session of the council, and Honorius III (1216&ndash;27) used the formula in two indulgences in favour of English beneficiaries.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN9"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
<p>It appears that the formula was not employed in English episcopal indulgences before the 1220s. For example, the remission of forty days&rsquo; penance granted around 1175 to contributors to the cathedral fabric fund by Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London (1163&ndash;87), contains only an echo of 2 Corinthians 9:6: &lsquo;Listen to your master; hear and receive his wise counsel. You can sow now what you would receive in eternal life. Now is winter, now the time to sow corn; but if the last hour has shut your eyes, this is no time to sow.&rsquo;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN10"><sup>10</sup></xref> A review of the first thirty-seven volumes of the <italic>English Episcopal Acta</italic> series reveals no example of the &lsquo;Quoniam ut ait&rsquo; formula earlier than an indulgence of 1231, itself modelled on an award of Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, to the same beneficiary and dated August 1226.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN11"><sup>11</sup></xref> In form, twelfth-century English indulgences rarely seem to have been composed according to a standard model, but rather were tailored to the beneficiaries, alluding, for example, to their patron saints or functions, and often, like Foliot&rsquo;s, so packed with scriptural allusions that they resembled short homilies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN12"><sup>12</sup></xref> The reproduction of the IV Lateran formula in 25124/1 suggests that it should not be dated earlier than 1215.</p>
<p>The decisive argument for the attribution of 25124/1 to Bishop Richard, however, is palaeographic: the document was written by a scribe responsible for three other precisely datable indulgences in the same collection, all of them awarded in London between 1237 and 1241. The first, 25124/10, by Christian, bishop of Emly in Ireland (1236 &times; 1237&ndash;1249), is dated 28 October 1237;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN13"><sup>13</sup></xref> the second, 25124/12, by Richard Wendene, bishop of Rochester (1238&ndash;50), 25 January 1240;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN14"><sup>14</sup></xref> and the third, 25124/15, by Hugh Pattishall, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield (1240&ndash;41), 9 November 1241.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN15"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
<p>The hand of all four indulgences is in an elaborate and polished chancery script that lacks the cursive traits to be seen in contemporary court scripts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN16"><sup>16</sup></xref> Its principal features may be summarized as follows. The majuscules <italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, <italic>H</italic>, <italic>O</italic>, <italic>P</italic>, <italic>Q</italic>, and <italic>R</italic> are usually written with doubled horizontal or vertical strokes, in the case of <italic>D</italic>, sometimes both; <italic>N</italic> with one or two horizontal middle strokes. Tironian <italic>et</italic> is barred with a concluding serif to the right. Among the minuscules, ascenders of <italic>b</italic>, <italic>d</italic> (where the upright, rather than the uncial, form is used), <italic>h</italic>, <italic>k</italic>, and <italic>l</italic> are slightly notched; the ascender of the two-compartment <italic>a</italic> extends as far above the headline as <italic>f</italic> and <italic>s-longa</italic>; the descenders of <italic>p</italic>, <italic>q</italic>, and <italic>r</italic> terminate in a leftward stroke; <italic>g</italic> is open and has a long, horizontal tail to the left, as does <italic>x</italic>; and the final stroke of terminal <italic>m</italic> and <italic>n</italic> curve down to the left and end in a horizontal rightward stroke, often with an additional horizontal cross-stroke through the descender. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the script consists in the short horizontal cross-strokes or flourishes joined by oblique hairlines with which the scribe decorates the ascenders of minuscule <italic>s</italic> and <italic>f</italic>; he occasionally employs a similar figure for the <italic>er</italic>, <italic>us</italic>, and <italic>um</italic> suspensions, which are otherwise indicated by the usual strokes. The scribe never identifies himself, but he might have been employed in the household of Roger Niger, bishop of London between 1229 and 1241, or by one of the other ecclesiastical bodies seated in London.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN17"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
<p>The physical layout of all four indulgences is similar: three (25124/1, 10, and 12) measure on average 190 &times; 135 mm (excluding the fold) and seals are attached by parchment double queues. More significantly, 25124/10 and 12 also employ the &lsquo;Quoniam ut ait&rsquo; formula, and the phrasing of the balance of the texts is virtually identical to that of 25124/1. Likewise, the <italic>mise en page</italic> of 25124/1, 10, and 12, including lineation, is similar. 25124/15 is smaller in format (170 &times; 96 mm) and employs a truncated formula from which scriptural allusions have been eliminated.</p>
<p>On balance, both the formal and the palaeographic evidence indicate that 25124/1 should be redated to 13 December 1240, Bishop Richard&rsquo;s fourth pontifical year.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN18"><sup>18</sup></xref> It therefore represents one of a clutch of indulgences awarded around the time of the dedication of St Paul&rsquo;s in 1241 rather than the earliest surviving fabric indulgence in the cathedral archive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="gjs138-FN19"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>

<fn id="gjs138-FN19"><p><sup>19</sup> Sparrow Simpson attributes 25123/13, a second undated indulgence by &lsquo;R,&rsquo; bishop of Bangor, to Bishop Richard (<italic>Documents</italic>, 175). It offers relaxation of thirty days&rsquo; penance to those who visit the cathedral &lsquo;on the feast of the dedication or its anniversary&rsquo; (&lsquo;in festo dedicationis seu eiusdem anniversario&rsquo;). If the reference is to the dedication itself, the document should be dated to 1241, but there is no reason to exclude any later year of Richard&rsquo;s episcopate. By the same token, the absence of any indication of date might support an earlier attribution, perhaps to Rotoland or Robert of Shrewsbury.</p></fn>
