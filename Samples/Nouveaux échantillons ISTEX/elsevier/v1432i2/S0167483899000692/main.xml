                    cells treated with LR12-GC followed by FITC-ASM, photographed using either rhodamine (B), FITC (C), or a double filter (D). The yellow color in D indicates colocalization of the

                    less intense than in B indicates that within 1 h the LR12-SPM was degraded by the FITC-ASM, while the LR12-GC was not. Note that in H, many fewer compartments appear yellow using
                    the double filter as compared to D, again indicating that much of the LR12-SPM had been degraded, leaving only green fluorescence derived from the FITC-ASM.</ce:simple-para>

                <ce:simple-para>A rapid purification method was developed to isolate milligram quantities of human acid sphingomyelinase from the media of overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells.
                    The purified, recombinant enzyme (rhASM) had physical and kinetic characteristics that were consistent with those reported for the non-recombinant enzyme, including an acidic pH
                    optimum and sensitivity to sulfhydryl reducing reagents and the zinc specific chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline. A novel assay using fluorescently conjugated sphingomyelin was
                    developed to explore the substrate binding properties of rhASM. Substrate binding required a fatty acid chain length of at least six carbons and the presence of the phosphocholine
                    headgroup on sphingomyelin. Substrate binding also required an acidic pH, and was inhibited by pretreatment of the enzyme with sulfhydral reducing reagents or 1,10-phenanthroline.
                    rhASM was rapidly internalized by cultured skin fibroblasts from Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) patients, and &#x223C;50% of this uptake was dependent on the mannose 6-phosphate
                    receptor system. Studies using FITC-labeled rhASM revealed that by 1 h the internalized enzyme was localized to acidic compartments and could degrade sphingomyelin, the first
                    demonstration that a lysosomal sphingolipid hydrolase can be fluorescently labeled and retain its biological activity. Intravenous injection of rhASM into ASM knock-out mice showed
                    that the <ce:italic>t</ce:italic><ce:inf>1/2</ce:inf> in the plasma was less than 5 min, and that the majority of the injected enzyme was taken up by the liver, followed by the
                    spleen. Thus, these studies lay the foundation for future structure/function investigations of ASM, further investigations into this enzyme&#x2019;s role in ceramide mediated
                    signal transduction, and the evaluation of enzyme replacement therapy for NPD using the mouse model.</ce:simple-para>

                <ce:para>Acid sphingomyelinase (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, E.C. 3.1.4.12; ASM) is the lysosomal enzyme which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphocholine
                        <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB1 BIB2">[1,2]</ce:cross-refs>. In man, a deficiency of this enzymatic activity leads to the type A and B forms of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD)
                        <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB3">[3]</ce:cross-ref>. Type A NPD is a severe, neuronopathic disorder which leads to death by 3 years of age. In contrast, patients with type B NPD have
                    little or no neurologic involvement and may survive into adolescence or adulthood. No treatment is available for either form of NPD. Mice in which the ASM gene has been inactivated
                    by gene targeting have been constructed (ASMKO mice), and the phenotype is intermediate between the human type A and B patients <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB4 BIB5"
                        >[4,5]</ce:cross-refs>. Affected animals appear normal at birth, develop neurologic symptoms by 3&#x2013;4 months of age, and usually die during the sixth or seventh
                    month.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>Human ASM has been purified from a variety of sources and extensively characterized (e.g. <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB6 BIB7 BIB8">[6&#x2013;8]</ce:cross-refs>). The full-length
                    cDNA and genomic sequences encoding human and murine ASM also have been isolated and characterized <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB9 BIB10 BIB11 BIB12">[9&#x2013;12]</ce:cross-refs>. The
                    human cDNA sequence predicted a 629 amino acid polypeptide containing six <ce:italic>N</ce:italic>-glycosylation sites. Site directed mutagenesis revealed that five of these sites
                    were utilized <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB13">[13]</ce:cross-ref>, predicting a molecular weight of &#x223C;70 kDa for the fully glycosylated protein after cleavage of the signal
                    peptide region (assuming a molecular weight of &#x223C;2 kDa per <ce:italic>N</ce:italic>-linked oligosaccharide). Biosynthetic studies in cultured skin fibroblasts have suggested
                    that ASM is synthesized as a 75 kDa precursor that is processed into several smaller molecular weight species (e.g. 72, 67 and 57 kDa) within lysosomes <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB14"
                        >[14]</ce:cross-ref>. Small amounts of the precursor and 57 kDa forms also were immunoprecipitated from the culture medium. The precise subunit structure of ASM is
                    unknown.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>Until recently, it was assumed that ASM was released from cells at very low levels. However, Schissel et al. showed in 1996 that some cell types release ASM at high levels,
                    and that the secreted enzyme (also known as S-SMase) required zinc cations to become activated <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB15">[15]</ce:cross-ref>. This activity resembled the zinc
                    activated ASM activity described more than a decade ago in bovine and human serum <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB16">[16]</ce:cross-ref>. Interestingly, the addition of zinc to the
                    intracellular ASM (also known as L-SMase) had little or no effect on its activity. Despite these differences, both forms of the enzyme were derived from the same primary transcript
                    and both were deficient in cells from NPD patients. Subsequent studies confirmed these observations and showed that S-SMase had a distinct <ce:italic>N</ce:italic>-glycosylation
                    pattern and N-terminal amino acid sequence as compared to L-SMase, and that L-SMase, while not stimulated by zinc, could be inactivated by treatment with the zinc-specific
                    chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB17">[17]</ce:cross-ref>. A definitive role for S-SMase has not been established, however the existence of this enzyme form may
                    explain the data of several laboratories indicating that ASM is involved in ceramide mediated signal transduction events at or near the cell surface (e.g. <ce:cross-refs
                        refid="BIB18 BIB19">[18,19]</ce:cross-refs>).</ce:para>
                <ce:para>The current paper describes the purification and characterization of recombinant human ASM from the media of overexpressing CHO cells, as well as experiments carried out in
                    NPD cells and ASMKO mice suggesting that the secreted enzyme may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of NPD patients. These data provide important information concerning
                    the basic biology of this hydrolase and lay the foundation for the future structure/function studies and the development of enzyme replacement therapy for NPD.</ce:para>

                            >[22]</ce:cross-ref>. Cells were harvested and sonicated in 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice using three 10 s bursts with 1 min intervals (Sonifier Cell Disruptor 200; Branson

                        Assays were generally carried out at 37&#x00B0;C for 30 min. After the reactions were complete, the assay mixtures were loaded onto thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (TLC

                            refid="BIB20 BIB21">[20,21]</ce:cross-refs>. This clone, designated CHO 18, had intracellular ASM activities that were up to &#x223C;70-fold higher than those found in the
                        parental CHO cells, and activity in the medium that was up to 700-fold higher than the parental cells <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB15 BIB17">[15,17]</ce:cross-refs>. The addition
                        of zinc cations was required to detect the markedly enhanced activity in the medium, but not in the cell extracts <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB15 BIB17"
                        >[15,17]</ce:cross-refs>.</ce:para>
                    <ce:para>A purification method was developed to rapidly isolate the secreted, recombinant human ASM (rhASM) from the media of these cells (<ce:cross-ref refid="TBL1">Table
                            1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="TBL1"/>). The purification scheme consisted of four steps; the first two ion exchange chromatography steps were performed in
                        &#x2018;batch&#x2019;, i.e. by mixing the enzyme solutions with the gel matrix, followed by bulk elutions (see <ce:cross-ref refid="SEC1">Section 2</ce:cross-ref> for details).
                        The final two steps were performed using an FPLC. To obtain large amounts of enzyme, the cells were routinely grown in a CELLMAX 100 bioreactor system. &#x223C;100 ml of medium
                        (CM-100) was harvested from the extracellular capillary space each day, ZnCl<ce:inf>2</ce:inf> (final concentration 0.1 mM) was added, and the enzyme solution was then stored
                        at 4&#x00B0;C for up to 1 week. When &#x223C;1 liter of medium was collected, the purification procedure was performed. ZnCl<ce:inf>2</ce:inf> was routinely added to the medium
                        since it had been shown to enhance the secreted ASM enzymatic activity <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB15 BIB17">[15,17]</ce:cross-refs>, and also stabilized the activity upon storage
                        at 4&#x00B0;C (not shown).</ce:para>
                    <ce:para>As can be seen in <ce:cross-ref refid="TBL1">Table 1</ce:cross-ref>, the final enrichment of the ASM enzymatic activity was &#x223C;100-fold and the final yield was
                        &#x223C;13%. The most efficient steps in this procedure used DEAE Sephacel; almost none of the rhASM bound to this matrix, while many other proteins in the media did, including
                        most of the serum albumin. Thus, more than a 30-fold enrichment of the enzyme could be achieved using these steps, with no loss of activity. Indeed, the amount of rhASM
                        activity detected after the two DEAE Sephacel steps was slightly higher than before, suggesting that either an inhibiting compound was removed by this procedure or a compound
                        which interfered with the assay system.</ce:para>

                        purification. The degree of enrichment achieved throughout the purification procedure is evident, particularly from the Western blot. At the final stage of purification
                        (post-Superose 12), a single, &#x223C;75 kDa Coomassie blue staining band was observed (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG1">Fig. 1A</ce:cross-ref>), which cross-reacted with polyclonal
                        antibodies raised against a purified, FLAG tagged ASM <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB17">[17]</ce:cross-ref> (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG1">Fig. 1B</ce:cross-ref>). A minor &#x223C;60
                        kDa band also reacted with the antibodies in some of the rhASM preparations and could occasionally be seen after silver staining, but usually represented less than 2% of the
                        total protein. Using this purification procedure, &#x223C;5 mg of rhASM could be routinely obtained from &#x223C;1 l of culture medium within 3 days.</ce:para>

                    <ce:para>The purified enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics using radioactive or fluorescent SPM as a substrate, and had a peak activity at pH 4.5 (not shown). Treatment of the

                        activity in a concentration and time-dependent fashion (<ce:cross-refs refid="FIG2 FIG3">Figs. 2 and 3</ce:cross-refs><ce:float-anchor refid="FIG2"/><ce:float-anchor
                            refid="FIG3"/>). Treatment of the purified enzyme with Endo H, PNG-F or sialidase revealed the presence of complex or hybrid type oligosaccharide chains containing sialic
                        acid residues and the lack of high mannose containing oligosaccharides (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG4">Fig. 4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="FIG4"/>). Similar results have
                        been reported previously for the ASM secreted from non-transfected CHO cells, while the carbohydrate chains on the L-SMase were mostly of the high mannose type <ce:cross-ref
                            refid="BIB17">[17]</ce:cross-ref>. Together, these data confirm previous observations on the properties of this hydrolase and support the notion that the human enzyme
                        purified from the media of the overexpressing CHO cells is biologically active, resembles the native enzyme, and could be useful therapeutically in NPD patients (see
                        below).</ce:para>
                    <ce:para>To investigate the substrate binding properties of the purified enzyme further, we developed a novel assay using fluorescently conjugated SPM derivatives. We believe that
                        this assay system primarily measures substrate binding, as opposed to hydrolysis, since most of the experiment was carried out in water at room temperature (optimal hydrolysis
                        of SPM by rhASM requires a buffered solution around pH 4.5 and incubation at 37&#x00B0;C). Indeed, the enzyme and substrate were only incubated together at pH 4.5 for a short
                        time (10 min) at room temperature, precluding the possibility of significant hydrolysis. Moreover, the intensity of the fluorescent signal bound to the immobilized enzyme after
                        washing the NCM was similar to that observed after the initial preincubation with substrate (data not shown). If substantial hydrolysis had occurred during the 2 h wash period,
                        this signal would have been significantly decreased.</ce:para>
                    <ce:para>As shown in <ce:cross-ref refid="FIG5">Fig. 5A</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="FIG5"/>, when LR12-SPM was incubated with purified rhASM which had been immobilized on
                        a nitrocellulose membrane, it bound tightly to the enzyme at pH 4.0, but not at pH 8.0, consistent with the fact that this substrate was readily degraded by rhASM at an acidic
                        pH. Similar findings were observed using several other fluorescent SPM substrates (data not shown), indicating that this result was not dependent on the fluorescent moiety. In
                        contrast, bacterial sphingomyelinase (bSMase), which has a neutral pH optimum, bound LR12-SPM at pH 8.0, but not pH 4.0 (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG5">Fig.
                        5A</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                    <ce:para>The purified enzyme was then incubated at pH 4.0 with LR0-SPM, LR6-SPM, and LR12-ceramide (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG5">Fig. 5B</ce:cross-ref>). Note that optimal binding
                        occurred with LR12-SPM, intermediate binding was observed with LR6-SPM, and no substrate binding was observed with LR0-SPM. This finding was consistent with the fact that
                        LR0-SPM could not be hydrolyzed by rhASM, and that the hydrolysis of LR6-SPM was less than that of LR12-SPM (data not shown). LR12-ceramide did not bind to the purified enzyme
                        as well. Interestingly, pretreated of rhASM with 1,10-phenanthroline or DTT inhibited binding of LR12-SPM in a concentration dependent fashion (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG6">Fig.
                            6</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="FIG6"/>), consistent with the inhibitory effects of these reagents on enzymatic activity. Thus, it likely that the reason
                        1,10-phenanthroline inhibits ASM activity is that zinc is required for efficient substrate binding. The specificity of this binding assay was further demonstrated by the fact
                        that the LR12-SPM could not bind to immobilized recombinant human &#x03B2;-glucosidase.</ce:para>

                    <ce:para>The uptake properties of the purified enzyme were examined using cultured type A NPD skin fibroblasts. As shown in <ce:cross-ref refid="FIG7">Fig.
                            7</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="FIG7"/>, addition of rhASM to the medium of NPD cells led to a marked increase in intracellular enzymatic activity within 16 h.
                        Indeed, the amount of activity detected within these cells was almost 2&#x2013;3-fold greater than that found in normal cells. Addition of M6P to the medium inhibited enzyme
                        uptake &#x223C;50%.</ce:para>
                    <ce:para>To determine whether the purified enzyme that was taken up by cells could degrade SPM, rhASM was labeled with FITC by linking the fluorescent probe to free amino groups
                        (see <ce:cross-ref refid="SEC1">Section 2</ce:cross-ref> for details). This modified, fluorescent form of the enzyme retained all of its catalytic activity in an in vitro assay
                        system (not shown), and was added to cultured NPD skin fibroblasts alone, or to cells that had been preloaded with pH sensitive LR12-SPM or LR12-GC as a negative control
                            (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG8">Fig. 8</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="FIG8"/>). These substrates are readily taken up by cells and only fluoresce in acidic compartments
                            <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB23 BIB24">[23,24]</ce:cross-refs>. Note that after 1 h of labeling both substrates can be seen in small vesicles spread throughout the cytoplasm.
                        Importantly, these vesicles appear yellow in cells that were treated with both the FITC-ASM and pH sensitive LR12-GC (which cannot be degraded by the recombinant ASM),
                        indicating colocalization to the same compartments. In cells colabeled with FITC-ASM and LR12-SPM, most of the vesicles appear green, indicating that the SPM has been degraded
                        by the recombinant enzyme and that the product, pH sensitive LR12-ceramide, translocated out of lysosomes to non-acidic compartments where it loses its fluorescence.</ce:para>
                    <ce:para>Based on these results, rhASM was injected intravenously into ASMKO mice (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG9">Fig. 9</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="FIG9"/>). Within 5 min,
                        almost all of the activity was absent from the plasma (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG9">Fig. 9A</ce:cross-ref>). This was not due to inhibition of the enzyme by plasma components
                        since incubation with plasma from ASMKO mice for up to 1 h at 37&#x00B0;C had no effect on the enzymatic activity (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG9">Fig. 9A</ce:cross-ref>, inset).
                        When tissues of the treated animals were analyzed for the presence of the ASM activity 1 h after the injection, most of the activity was found in the liver, followed by small
                        amounts in the spleen, heart, and kidney (<ce:cross-ref refid="FIG9">Fig. 9B</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>

                <ce:section-title>Discussion</ce:section-title>
                <ce:para>Since it was first identified as the enzymatic defect in NPD in the late 1960s, ASM has been the subject of much research. While important progress has resulted from these
                    efforts, structural information is still lacking for this enzyme and essential features governing its catalytic activity remain unknown. In part, this is due to the fact that it is
                    expressed in low quantities in most natural sources, and highly purified enzyme has been difficult to obtain in large enough quantities to pursue many research goals. This same
                    limitation has also prevented the evaluation of enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of NPD. The recent identification of ASM&#x2019;s role in ceramide mediated signal
                    transduction has stimulated renewed interest in this hydrolase and highlighted the need for additional reagents to facilitate large-scale production, purification, and
                    characterization. This manuscript reports the development of such a reagent, and documents many features of the human enzyme secreted from genetically engineered CHO cells. A
                    recent report also has documented overexpression of rhASM in insect Sf21 cells <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB26">[26]</ce:cross-ref>.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>CHO 18 cells exhibited a remarkable degree of ASM overexpression in the media and in cells. A rapid and simple purification procedure was developed which permitted the
                    isolation of milligram quantities of rhASM from the CHO 18 medium within several days. ZnCl<ce:inf>2</ce:inf> was routinely added to the media and maintained in most of
                    purification buffers since zinc cations not only enhanced the activity of the secreted ASM, but also stabilized its activity upon storage at 4&#x00B0;C. This observation was
                    consistent with other reports studying secreted ASM (S-SMase) from several different cell types <ce:cross-refs refid="BIB15 BIB17">[15,17]</ce:cross-refs>. SDS-PAGE analysis
                    revealed that the purified enzyme migrated as a single, diffuse band with an <ce:italic>M</ce:italic><ce:inf>r</ce:inf> of &#x223C;75 kDa. Occasionally, a minor &#x223C;60 kDa band
                    representing 2% or less of the total protein also was visible by protein staining or on Western blots. The relative amount of this form increased depending on how long the medium
                    was stored at 4&#x00B0;C prior to purification (not shown), suggesting that it was a degradation product due to protease and/or glycosylase digestion.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>The focus of our efforts was to characterize the properties of the ASM secreted from the overexpressing cells, rather than the intracellular activity, since this form of the
                    enzyme was easily purified away from the medium components and could be obtained in large quantities for therapeutic evaluation. It should be noted that FLAG-tagged rhASM also has
                    been purified from the media of transfected CHO cells, as well as a lysosome enriched intracellular fraction <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB17">[17]</ce:cross-ref>. That work concluded
                    that the two enzyme forms (i.e. secreted and intracellular) underwent distinct trafficking events based on their unique N-terminal sequences and
                    <ce:italic>N</ce:italic>-glycosylation patterns. It was further hypothesized that the intracellular, L-SMase was exposed to cellular zinc during trafficking to lysosomes or in
                    lysosomes (explaining why it was not zinc stimulated), while the S-SMase was sequestered from the cellular pools of zinc and therefore required exogenous zinc for complete
                    activation.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>The secreted rhASM characterized in this paper also was zinc-activated and had a molecular weight (&#x223C;75 kDa) similar to what has been reported previously for the
                    secreted FLAG-tagged rhASM. It also had many features of human ASM purified from natural sources, including an acidic pH optimum and cross-reactivity with anti-human ASM polyclonal
                    antibodies. The <ce:italic>M</ce:italic><ce:inf>r</ce:inf> was slightly higher than that reported for human ASM purified from human urine and spleen (&#x223C;68&#x2013;72 kDa), but
                    was consistent with the fact that the secreted enzyme was probably a precursor form. The secretion of such precursor forms has been reported previously for several other lysosomal
                    enzymes produced in similar overexpression systems (e.g. <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB27">[27]</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para>
                <ce:para>To investigate the substrate specificity of the purified enzyme further, we developed a novel, substrate binding assay. Purified rhASM was immobilized on nitrocellulose
                    membranes and incubated with a fluorescent SPM derivative, LR12-SPM, a substrate which is known to be degraded efficiently by ASM from a variety of enzyme sources (e.g.
                        <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB22">[22]</ce:cross-ref>). LR12-SPM binding was pH dependent, consistent with the fact that rhASM has a sharp pH optimum of &#x223C;4.5, and could be
                    inhibited by pretreatment of the enzyme with sulfhydryl reducing reagents or 1,10-phenanthroline. It is notable that a recent report showed that ASM secreted from CHO cell medium
                    could hydrolyze SPM presented in the context of a lipoprotein particle at neutral pH <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB28">[28]</ce:cross-ref>. On the surface, this result may appear
                    contradictory to the findings reported here regarding the pH dependence of substrate binding, however the reaction conditions, substrates used, and purity of the ASM being analyzed
                    were completely different in these two studies, precluding their direct comparison.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>Of note, three other lissamine rhodamine derivatives were tested for their ability to bind rhASM: LR0 and LR6-SPM, and LR12-ceramide. LR0-SPM has the lissamine rhodamine
                    moiety linked directly to the sphingosine backbone, while the LR6 and LR12-ceramide compounds have lissamine rhodamine conjugated via 6 or 12 carbon linkers. LR12-ceramide is the
                    product of LR12-SPM hydrolysis by ASM, and lacks the phosphocholine moiety of sphingomyelin.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>The results of these studies suggested that a fatty acid moiety containing at least six, and more optimally 12 carbons, is required to achieve efficient binding and
                    degradation of sphingomyelin by ASM and that the phosphocholine moiety is essential for substrate binding, suggesting that after hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by ASM, the ceramide
                    produced is released rapidly from the enzyme for further metabolism.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>Investigating some of these features further, we performed an alignment of the amino acid sequences of human and murine ASM, and two ASM sequences obtained from
                        <ce:italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</ce:italic>
                    <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB29">[29]</ce:cross-ref>. Of note, 14 of the 16 cysteine residues in human ASM were completely conserved among man, mouse and <ce:italic>C.
                        elegans</ce:italic>. Also of interest, a point mutation at one of these conserved cysteine residues (C431 in human ASM), is known to inactivate ASM and lead to NPD (unpublished
                    observation). Cysteine residues, which are important in the formation of intra and/or intermolecular disulfide bonds, also can be involved in zinc binding, as are histidine
                    residues. Of the 18 histidine residues in human ASM, six are completely conserved among man, mouse and <ce:italic>C. elegans</ce:italic>. Mutations causing NPD are known to occur
                    at H425 and H575, and one of these (H425), is within a sequence of five amino acids that is completely conserved. Furthermore, near H425 is another histidine, H421, which is
                    conserved in several zinc metalloenzymes, including a cGMP specific phosphodiesterase <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB30">[30]</ce:cross-ref>, and is also conserved among human, mouse, and
                    one of the <ce:italic>C. elegans</ce:italic> ASM sequences. Intriguingly, the <ce:italic>C. elegans</ce:italic> sequence in which H421 is conserved is zinc activated, while the
                    other is not <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB29">[29]</ce:cross-ref>.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>The usefulness of rhASM for the development and evaluation of enzyme replacement therapy for NPD also was studied. Cell culture experiments revealed that the enzyme was
                    rapidly taken up by NPD skin fibroblasts, and that this uptake could be partially inhibited by the addition of M6P to the culture medium. Previous studies have shown that
                    50&#x2013;70% of rhASM released into the medium of the overexpressing CHO 18 cells binds to a M6P receptor column, consistent with these findings <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB17"
                        >[17]</ce:cross-ref>. Moreover, studies reported in this manuscript using Endo H and PNG-F confirmed that this purified form of ASM lacks high mannose containing
                    oligosaccharides and consists of mainly complex and hybrid type carbohydrates. Thus, it appears from these results that while M6P targeting is the primary mechanism by which rhASM
                    is taken up by cells, it is not the only mechanism. This is consistent with previous observations <ce:cross-ref refid="BIB14">[14]</ce:cross-ref>.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>The recombinant enzyme also was fluorescently labeled with FITC and the fluorescent enzyme was shown to be internalized by cells, localized in acidic compartments, and able to
                    degrade SPM in these compartments. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that a lysosomal sphingolipid hydrolase could be fluorescently labeled and retain its biological
                    activity. The rhASM also was intravenously injected into ASMKO mice, and its clearance from the circulation was monitored. Within 5 min after the injection virtually all of the
                    activity was absent from the plasma. This observation was not due to inactivation by plasma proteases or pH, since incubation of the enzyme with plasma at 37&#x00B0;C for up to 1 h
                    did not lead to inactivation. Moreover, most of the injected activity could be recovered in the liver, followed by small amounts in the spleen, heart and kidney. Since the Kupffer
                    cells of the liver (and to a lesser degree the hepatocytes) are an important site of pathology in NPD, these results suggest that enzyme replacement may be a useful approach for
                    the treatment of patients who do not have major central nervous system involvement (i.e. type B NPD). Studies designed to evaluate this therapeutic approach in the ASMKO mice are
                    currently under way.</ce:para>
                <ce:para>Thus, the data reported in this paper should be of importance to both basic scientists studying the biology of ASM and to researchers involved in the development of enzyme
                    replacement therapy for NPD and other storage diseases. The construction of the CHO 18 overexpressing cell line and the purification methods described within have already provided
                    new reagents and information concerning this enzyme, and it is anticipated that they will lead to interesting new areas of research investigation.</ce:para>
