               <p>Long-term high intensity athletic training is known to increase cardiac dimensions <ref target="#BIB1 #BIB2">[1,2]</ref>, in particular, left ventricular
                    cavity size and wall thickness <ref target="#BIB3">[3]</ref>. However, there is a ‘grey area’ between athletes who appear to have particularly large
                    left ventricular wall dimensions and those with pathological forms of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In order to aid differentiation
                    between normal physiological adaptation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an ‘upper limit’ of physiological hypertrophy of 16 mm has been suggested, although few
                    athletes in this study had maximum wall thickness &gt;12 mm <ref target="#BIB4">[4]</ref>.</p>
               <p>Certain sports such as rowing, canoeing and cycling which involve both isotonic and isometric exercise have been identified as being more likely to cause cardiac enlargement
                        <ref target="#BIB4 #BIB5">[4,5]</ref>, although reports of cardiac enlargement in strength athletes, such as weightlifters or bodybuilders are more
                    controversial due to their extremely large body size <ref target="#BIB6 #BIB7">[6,7]</ref>. There are few data examining elite football players, studies having
                    relatively small numbers <ref target="#BIB8 #BIB9 #BIB10 #BIB11">[8–11]</ref> or being included in larger groups of athletes from other disciplines
                        <ref target="#BIB4">[4]</ref>.</p>
               <p>The purpose of this study was to examine, by echocardiography, the cardiac dimensions in elite football players in comparison to healthy controls and to further define the
                    prevalence of ‘athlete’s heart’ in this population.</p>

               <head>Materials and methods</head>
               <p>A total of 141 full-time male football players and 32 healthy male controls were studied. The football players were from the playing staff of two Scottish Premier Division
                    football clubs and from the national youth squad. Many of the players had represented their country at international level and hence comprised an ‘elite’ group.
                    Controls were recruited from healthy members of hospital staff and were matched for height, weight and body surface area and were not taking regular physical exercise. Assuming an
                    expected difference in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) between footballers and controls of 15 g/m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> and a standard deviation of 20 g/m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>, the
                    above sample sizes provide a power of 0.97 to detect a difference at <hi rend="italic">P</hi>&lt;0.05. Age, height, weight and body surface area (BSA) by Dubois’ formula
                        <ref target="#BIB12">[12]</ref>) were recorded for each subject and control. Each footballer’s normal playing position was noted.</p>
               <p>Echocardiography was performed on an Acuson 128XP/10c computed sonography platform with a variable frequency (2–5 MHz) vector array format transducer. M-Mode images
                    were obtained by one of two experienced echocardiographers (DM, GMcC) from left parasternal and apical views with the subjects in the left recumbent position. M-Mode images were
                    obtained by direct visualisation of the left ventricle, left atrium or aortic root in order to ensure perpendicular sections. All examinations were recorded on S-VHS videotape and
                    analysed later using the on-board software package by one operator (DM) and according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines <ref target="#BIB13 #BIB14 #BIB15">[13–15]</ref>. Particular effort was made not to include overlying trabeculations in the ventricular septum or posterior wall
                    measurements, which may overestimate wall thickness. Each measurement was made on three consecutive cardiac cycles and an average of the three values was noted. Left ventricular
                    mass (LVmass) was calculated by Devereux’ formula <ref target="#BIB16">[16]</ref> and left ventricular mass index by dividing LVmass by body surface area.
                    Relative wall thickness in diastole (RWTd) was calculated according to the following formula, in order to classify the type of hypertrophy, where present:Four patterns of left ventricular
                    geometry were therefore defined, based on an upper normal limit for LVMI of 124 g/m<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> and RWTd of 0.44, according to previously defined criteria <ref target="#BIB17">[17]</ref>: (1) concentric hypertrophy (increased LVMI and RWTd); (2) eccentric hypertrophy (increased LVMI and normal RWTd); (3) concentric remodelling
                    (normal LVMI and increased RWTd); and (4) normal geometry (normal LVMI and normal RWTd).</p>
               <p>Left ventricular diastolic filling patterns were assessed by mitral pulse-wave Doppler echocardiography using standard techniques. Aortic valve flow was assessed by continuous
                    wave Doppler in order to exclude significant valvular or sub-valvular obstruction.</p>
               <p>Statistical analysis was carried out using unpaired <hi rend="italic">t</hi>-tests between groups. Statistical significance is stated as <hi rend="italic">P</hi>&lt;0.05
                    and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are given.</p>
               <p>In addition to formal statistical testing, the number of subjects and controls with an absolute maximum wall thickness outside the normal range (8–12 mm) were noted in
                    order to further define the prevalence of ‘athlete’s heart’.</p>

               <p>Demographic characteristics of the two groups are shown in <ref target="#TBL1">Table 1</ref>
                  <ptr target="#TBL1"/>. Footballers were slightly younger
                    than controls but there were no significant differences in height, weight or body surface area. Heart rate was significantly lower in footballers than in controls.</p>
               <p>The echocardiographic dimensions are shown in <ref target="#TBL2">Table 2</ref>
                  <ptr target="#TBL2"/>. Each of inter-ventricular septum, left
                    ventricular diastolic dimension, left ventricular posterior wall, left ventricular systolic dimension and aortic root were significantly greater in players than controls. LVmass
                    and LVMI were also both significantly greater in players than in controls.</p>
               <p>Doppler measurements are shown in <ref target="#TBL3">Table 3</ref>
                  <ptr target="#TBL3"/>. The functional indices of diastolic filling were normal in
                    both footballers and controls, although E/A ratio was higher in footballers than in controls. Aortic velocity was significantly higher in controls than footballers although within
                    the normal range in both groups.</p>
               <p>No controls had interventricular septum or posterior wall dimensions greater than 12 mm. Results from subjects with LVH are shown in <ref target="#TBL4">Table
                        4</ref>
                  <ptr target="#TBL4"/>. In all, 17 footballers (12%) had a maximal wall thickness &gt;12 mm, which was not, in general, associated with cavity dilatation.
                    An heterogeneous pattern of left ventricular geometry was observed (seven subjects with concentric hypertrophy; seven subjects with eccentric hypertrophy, and three subjects with
                    concentric remodelling).</p>
               <p>No specific playing position was associated with LVH, all playing positions being represented in the group with maximum wall thickness &gt;12 mm.</p>

               <head>Discussion</head>
               <p>Football places demands on the cardiovascular system characterised by intermittent high intensity exercise. Analysis of elite Danish footballers showed a time–activity
                    profile for an entire game of: standing (17.1%), walking (40.4%), low intensity activities including jogging (35.1%), moderate speed running (5.3%), high speed running (2.1%) and
                    sprinting (0.7%) <ref target="#BIB18">[18]</ref>. However, the cardiovascular adaptations to exercise in this population are more likely to reflect the workload of
                    training, since more time is spent in training than in competitive match-play. Little work has been done in this area, but energy expenditure during training has been estimated at
                    around 6100 kJ/session <ref target="#BIB19">[19]</ref>, whereas energy expenditure during match-play has been estimated at around 5700 kJ <ref target="#BIB20">[20]</ref>. In general, most footballers train as a squad and perform both aerobic and resistance work during each session, although goalkeepers tend to
                    undergo more specifically tailored regimes.</p>
               <p>The largest study in footballers to date, including 62 Olympic standard players, suggests that wall thickness is not increased outwith the normal range <ref target="#BIB4">[4]</ref>, and other smaller studies agree with this observation <ref target="#BIB8 #BIB9 #BIB10 #BIB11">[8–11]</ref>. However, the
                    present study indicates that elite footballers have significantly increased cardiac dimensions compared with healthy controls. In contrast to other data suggesting that it is
                    mainly cavity size that is enlarged in endurance athletes (i.e. eccentric hypertrophy) <ref target="#BIB1 #BIB21 #BIB22">[1,21,22]</ref>, both left ventricular
                    cavity size and wall thickness are significantly greater in footballers than in controls and a variety of left ventricular geometric patterns are seen. The present study shows that
                    a maximal wall thickness &gt;12 mm was present in 17 subjects (12%), the highest measurement being 15 mm. In general, most of these footballers did not have co-existing cavity
                    dilatation outwith the normal range (≤55 mm). Increased wall thickness without cavity dilatation has been suggested to be more in keeping with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
                    than ‘athlete’s heart’, but this is not borne out in this population.</p>
               <p>It has been suggested that maximum wall thickness rarely exceeds 13 mm in ‘athlete’s heart’ <ref target="#BIB4">[4]</ref>, and that
                    maximum wall thickness outwith this range is suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. None of our subjects with maximal wall thickness ≥13 mm had other features of
                    hypertrophic cardiomyopathy such as systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, left ventricular outflow tract gradient, abnormal doppler filling pattern or abnormal ECGs and we
                    consider it very unlikely that any of the subjects had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is around 1 in 500 <ref target="#BIB23">[23]</ref>, making the diagnosis statistically improbable in a study group of this size. No subject had other identifiable causes of left ventricular
                    hypertrophy such as hypertension or aortic valve disease. Our data show a higher E/A ratio in footballers compared with controls, in keeping with improved diastolic function. This
                    is in contrast to other causes of LVH, which cause diastolic dysfunction <ref target="#BIB24 #BIB25 #BIB26">[24–26]</ref> and E/A reversal.</p>
               <p>The echocardiographic examinations were performed taking care to ensure that the M-mode section was perpendicular to the left ventricle in order to minimise measurement errors
                    and special attention was given to overlying structures such as the moderator band, which may be erroneously included in the septal dimension. Therefore overestimation of the LV
                    wall thickness is an unlikely explanation for the LVH.</p>
               <p>The reason why the present study found a higher proportion of subjects with LVH than previous studies and why the type of LVH was different (increased wall thickness without
                    chamber enlargement) is not clear. The study group is larger than in other studies, but even allowing for this the proportion seems high. It is recognised that the classical
                    ‘British’ style of play is characterised by high work rates for outfield players <ref target="#BIB27">[27]</ref> and therefore a very high degree of
                    cardiovascular fitness is necessary. Consequently, training methods in the UK may differ from those of the populations previously studied, although we are not aware of any
                    published data to indicate that this is the case. A further possible explanation for the LVH is different training regimes with more emphasis on resistance training. However,
                    objective information from the training staff does not indicate that this is the case as all players underwent resistance training two or three times per week in addition to
                    communal ‘squad-based’ training. There was no apparent effect of different playing positions on the development of LVH in this study, although the study may not be
                    sufficiently powered to detect such an influence.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, the present study shows that a high proportion of elite footballers develop left ventricular enlargement, especially an increase in LV wall thickness. This
                    knowledge is important in distinguishing ‘athlete’s heart’ from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in this population. Further work is required to establish why only
                    some elite athletes develop LVH and whether this confers a performance benefit. Since training regimes are similar, a genetic predisposition for the development of LVH seems
                    probable.</p>
